86,titanic IS A classic DOT i was really surprised that this movie didn T have A solid ten overall IN the imdb USER rankings DOT maybe it s just cool TO NOT give titanic credit nowadays but WHEN it was FIRST made it was really something DOT WHEN the movie came OUT people flocked TO the theaters DOT WHEN it came OUT ON video my sister AND i would watch it twice A DAY FOR A MONTH DOT it was safe TO say we were obsessed AND FOR good reason DOT SOME OF the disaster scenes were hard TO forgot LIKE the frozen baby OR the guy who COMMITTED suicide AFTER killing someone IN the unruly crowd DOT many people died ON that ship AND TO convey that ON film WITH the immediacy AND emotion it needed IS A hard challenge that james cameron stepped up TO DOT AND let s NOT forget the amazing romance BETWEEN jack AND rose DOT whether OR NOT their relationship was A figment OF someone s imagination it was lovely DOT they barely knew EACH other but they would die FOR EACH other DOT they TRUSTED EACH other DOT they sure AS hell ARE giving romeo AND juliet A run FOR their money DOT i ll never let GO jack DOT titanic IS A great film down TO it s very core DOT it IS A powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music AND A crew FULL OF hard AND dedicated workers DOT it really blows my mind WHEN someone says they hate this movie DOT,safe

88,another aussie masterpiece this delves INTO the world OF the UNKNOWN AND the supernatural AND it does very well DOT it doesn T resort TO the big special effects overkill LIKE american flicks it focuses MORE ON emotional impact DOT A relatively SIMPLE plot that rebecca gibney co DOT bring TO life DOT it follows the story OF A couple who buy an OLD house that was supposedly home TO A very OLD woman who never went outside AND whose husband disappeared IN mysterious circumstances A century ago DOT strange things BEGIN TO happen IN the house AND john adam begins TO turn INTO the man who disappeared who was actually A mass murderer DOT highly recommended DOT,safe

90,FOR me personally this film goes down IN my top four OF ALL TIME DOT NO exceptions DOT james cameron has proved himself TIME AND TIME again that he IS A master storyteller DOT through films such AS aliens the abyss AND BOTH terminators it IS clear that he was A brilliant AND confidant director AS far AS ACTION AND science fiction goes DOT he sees A story AND adds A strange quality TO the film DOT but titanic IS so much different TO his other strokes OF brilliance DOT the film IS exceptionally moving AND allows room FOR surprises plot development AND interesting CHARACTER developments IN A story that everyone knows DOT the story OF the famed voyager sinking ON her maiden voyage IS legend so the challenge was FOR cameron TO make A truthful interesting AND entertaining film about it DOT the acting IS wonderful AS leonardo dicaprio who plays jack AND kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight WITH the RELEASE OF this film AND IN most films i GET annoyed WHEN the supporting CHARACTERS aren T given A lot TO DO but IN this film it IS MORE purposeful because AS an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it IS quickly apparent that it IS rose s AND jack s story alone NO one ELSE DOT emotionally it IS entirely satisfying AND can LEAVE NO dry eye IN A theater OR home DOT the music has become iconic AND legendary DOT it IS composer james horner s finest soundtrack ever AND evokes so much FROM the film AND the audience DOT the song AFTER so LONG has become annoying but i still appreciate it FOR the phenomenon it IS AND this film IS DOT ONLY one problem the usual james cameron problem IS the dialogue which IS memorable but IN A bad way AS IN how cheesy it IS AT points but ALL that aside DOT james cameron has delivered A masterpiece AND A romantic epic that sweeps you away ON A journey OF A lifetime DOT my heart won T GO ON FROM this one DOT,safe

lifeboats have gone AND the ship finally goes down INTO the freezing atlantic taking jack AND rose down DOT br br so does titanic live up TO it s hype i still say that this IS A great movie TO watch i think that there were AND still ARE quite A few haters that FOR SOME reason just want TO trash the movie because it had won A ton OF awards AND everyone was IN love WITH the movie DOT but it has great acting amazing effects A well written story AND still looks flawless DOT love it OR hate it you have TO admit this movie didn T GET A lot OF hype just because OF leo s baby face OR kate s amazing

98,titanic directed BY james cameron presents A fictional love story ON the historical setting OF the titanic DOT the plot IS SIMPLE noncomplicated OR NOT FOR those who love plots that twist AND turn AND keep you IN suspense DOT the END OF the movie can be figured OUT WITHIN minutes OF the START OF the film but the love story IS an interesting one however DOT kate winslett IS wonderful AS rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed BY cal billy zane DOT early ON the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio A LOWER CLASS artist ON his way TO america AFTER winning his ticket aboard titanic IN A poker game DOT IF he wants something he goes AND gets it unlike the UPPER CLASS who ARE so concerned WITH their social worries DOT the two fall IN love AND the audience sees the sinking OF the titanic primarily through their eyes DOT br br the movie begins IN modern times WITH the exploration OF the wreck BY A GROUP searching FOR treasures that sunk WITH the titanic which has recently occurred DOT one OF the survivors OF the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard OF the exploration OF the wreck ON television AND IS flown TO the boat WHERE the SEARCH IS being led FROM TO tell OF what she remembers TO help the SEARCH DOT she gets TO telling her memory OF the one AND ONLY voyage OF the titanic DOT WITH this the scene shifts TO southhampton ireland WHERE the titanic SET sail FROM ON april AS ALL the passengers ARE boarding DOT AFTER another stop ON the irish coast titanic went OUT TO see ON its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound FOR NEW york DOT historically the FIRST few days OF the voyage went BY uneventful but the fictional plot OF the story IS developed during this TIME AS rose sees the hopeless entrapement OF an engagement that she IS IN TO the wealthy cal hockley AND falls IN love WITH third CLASS passenger jack dawson DOT captain smith alledgedly AS shown IN the movie was urged BY the white star line director TO increase the speed OF the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines AND receive extra publicity BY arriving IN NEW york ON thursday night AND NOT ON friday morning AS planned DOT smith THEN ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years OF experience TO stretch the titanic s legs OUT TO FULL speed DOT the titanic had reports that the waters IN the atlantic they were sailing IN were FULL OF icebergs but they ignored these warnings AND proceeded AT FULL speed AS shown IN the movie DOT ON april AT an iceberg was sighted DOT they attempted TO shut OFF the engines AND turn the ship OUT OF the PATH OF the iceberg but there was NOT enough TIME AND the ship hit the iceberg ON the starboard side AS depicted IN the film DOT the portrayal OF the many small holes IN the side OF the ship AND NOT one LARGE gash along the side IS accurate DOT the crew OF titanic sent OUT distress calls AND SET OFF distress rockets AS shown UNTIL WHEN the lights finally failed DOT the lights OF the california were spotted six miles away but they failed TO realize what was going ON AND did NOT respond TO titanic s many pleas FOR help DOT the california had tried earlier IN the DAY TO warn titanic OF the severe ice that had caused them TO stop their trip but titanic had brushed them OFF causing the california TO turn OFF its radio AND LEAVE the titanic ON its own DOT the FIRST CLASS women AND children were the FIRST AS depicted TO be put INTO the twenty lifeboats that were ON the ship DOT overwhelmingly the third CLASS passengers suffered the most amount OF deaths OF ANY CLASS AND the crew was hit hard IN this tragedy too DOT the word OF white star line employees AND FIRST CLASS passengers was believed OVER that OF SECOND AND third CLASS passengers WHEN authorities were trying TO gain information OF the sinking DOT ALSO the metal that was used TO build the titanic has been FOUND IN recent years UNDER conditions OF severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank TO be extremely brittle DOT overall the basic plot IS very accurate IN its portayal OF the events AND the times AT which these events took place ON the titanic DOT br br many OF the CHARACTERS IN the story were NOT REAL AND created simply FOR the purpose OF the movie OR AS composite CHARACTERS TO represent possible CHARACTERISTICS AND ideas OF people ON the ship DOT the core GROUP OF rose jack cal AND rose s mother ALL were fictional CHARACTERS added INTO the story AS they represent different GROUPS OF people FROM the TIME DOT yet many CHARACTERS such AS the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay AND ALL OF the titanic s officers were REAL DOT the maiden voyage was going TO be captain edward smith s LAST voyage anyway AS he planned TO retire afterwards DOT he had been A part OF the white star line since WHERE he worked his way up TO his status AS the millionaire s captain WHEN the titanic sunk DOT the portrayals OF the officers IS accurate AS ONLY four survived the tragedy EXCEPT FOR the officer who threatened TO kill ALL OF the passengers OF the ship WITH his pistol DOT he IS ON record AS acting heroicly AND was misportrayed TO the point that james cameron apologized AND evoked A monument IN his honor IN the officer s former canadian hometown DOT AS shown IN the movie there was A LANGUAGE problem BETWEEN the crew AND many OF the LOWER CLASS passengers FROM non english speaking nations DOT IN addition officer lowe was the ONLY officer who came back IN the lifeboat AS depicted DOT the OLD people shown IN their bed AS the water came IN their room were based ON the strauss DOT NOT wanting TO LEAVE her husband s side mrs DOT strauss refused TO GET IN her lifeboat AND died WITH her husband ON the titanic DOT furthermore mr DOT goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy AND smoking A cigar reportedly did GO OUT LIKE this dressed IN his best DOT the richest man ON the ship john jacob astor who OWNED most OF manhattan died nonetheless AS well but his much younger wife was saved IN A lifeboat DOT IN addition molly brown was saved AND later had medals made up FOR the crew OF the carpethia that picked the survivors OF titanic up FROM the water DOT her ticket ON the titanic had COST OVER four thousand dollars AND BY the END OF her life she ended up broke DOT ALL OF the interiors OF the ship were masterfully replacated down TO the LAST pieces OF china AND silverware DOT the gymnasium which IS hardly seen IS recreated perfectly WITH ALL OF the machines reproduced TO MATCH those seen IN OLD photographs DOT the wonderful outfits AND costuming were an excellent re creation OF the post victorian era OF DOT the rich AT this TIME practically ruled everything AS the women s suffrage movement had NOT quite gotten moving yet DOT women during this TIME often married FOR financial SECURITY AS rose was considering doing AND normally took A back seast status TO their husbands AS cal wished FOR rose TO DO DOT the rich did NOT take well TO NEW money such AS molly brown AS depicted DOT everything OF the TIME was very formal DOT women had TO be escorted TO dinner BY A male figure AS seen WITH IN the dining scenes DOT smoking was NOT very common among women OF the TIME but holders OF cigarettes which were just coming IN AT the TIME were used AS seen WITH rose IN the movie DOT men OF the TIME generally smoked cigars NOT cigarettes DOT women were constained physically BY their corsets AND socially BY society DOT although james cameron had NO background IN historical films he brought IN experts OF titanic coupled WITH two years spent CROSS REFERENCING the history OF the titanic AND few liberties were taken DOT the beautiful cinematography AND special effects ALSO helped TO make the film even MORE breathtaking DOT br br A recognizable message can be seen IN the movie titanic AS the people ON the ship had about three hours TO contemplate their demise DOT the director james cameron shows the various reactions TO this TIME OF crisis IN people s lives DOT everyone reacts differently AND he gets you TO think OF how you might have reacted had you been IN that situation ON the titanic ON that fateful night DOT IN addition this film IS A reflection OF the s WHEN it was produced AS it gives A look INTO the wreck OF the titanic DOT ONLY IN the past fifteen years has the site OF the actual titanic been FOUND AND explored DOT this movie was able TO give us A deeper look INTO A disaster that many would NOT have viewed DOT however the moral question OF whether people today should be taking treasures FROM the wreck OF an underwater graveyard IS posed DOT there have been attempts TO stop treasure seeking missions such AS the one portrayed IN titanic but ALL have failed DOT AS it stands today anyone can make A voyage TO the titanic AND take whatever valuables they AS portrayed IN the film showing the GENERAL VALUES OF our TIME ON this matter DOT br br technically the film IS very well done DOT TO GET footage OF the wreck AT the bottom OF the ocean it took twelve dives TO GET ALL OF the footage needed FOR the movie DOT IN addition A special camera had TO be created TO withstand the intense pressure AT the bottom OF the ocean DOT cameron did NOT plan ON USING the probe TO GO AS far inside titanic AS anyone has IN the years since the ship sunk but it worked OUT that this provided an UNIQUE perspective INTO the ship DOT furthermore throughout the film fade ins AND outs FROM the wreck OF titanic TO the scene OF titanic during its actual voyage DOT this shift BETWEEN the modern scene TO the past scene during the voyage works AS an excellent transition that makes the story easy TO follow IN aclear manner DOT AT the very beginning OF the movie A septune recreation IS used TO recreate the scene WHEN the actual people LEFT the european coast ON titanic giving it distinction FROM the rest OF the events OF the film DOT br br titanic plays almost LIKE A historical biography AND IS LIKE A WORK OF art A TRUE epic DOT LIKE most history novels we know the ending but it doesn T take away FROM the wonderful treats that can be FOUND IN this picture DOT certain aspects

127,superman ii the richard donner cut should be A fan s dream come TRUE DOT AT LONG LAST footage ONLY seen IN photos AND scenes that ONLY existed ON the printed page would finally come TO life DOT A director that was unable TO complete his vision would have the opportunity TO have his vision restored DOT it seems LIKE A winning situation DOT AND THEN you START watching this assembly OF footage AND you realize this esoteric dream IS A very REAL nightmare OF sloppiness AND incompetence DOT WHILE it s entirely possible that NO movie could compete WITH the finished perfect VERSION EACH OF us has imagined OVER the years it really should have been A thrill TO finally see this project DOT AND it IS ONLY A very few times DOT br br you know things ARE shaky WHEN the very FIRST BIT OF TEXT ON screen looks LIKE home brew computer graphics DOT but THEN we START seeing NEW footage alternates FROM superman the movie FOR the trial AND that FIRST BIT OF hesitation fades away DOT hey this IS pretty neat things ARE alright FOR these few fleeting moments UNTIL we see footage FROM stm intermixed WITH NEW effects FOR this project AND it doesn T convince AT ALL DOT AND FROM this point ON it never ever lets up DOT it s probably NOT RIGHT TO judge A movie because OF bad visual effects but WHEN this IS supposedly the direct follow up TO A movie whose tag line was you ll believe A man can fly it s difficult TO believe anything shown ON screen here DOT the best effects IN this ARE FROM the original productions DOT br br another issue WITH this re cut DOT A lot OF it just doesn T make sense DOT the ONLY reason ANY OF it really works IS because we ve ALL seen the theatrical VERSION OF superman ii A movie that does make sense DOT lester s superman ii fills IN the holes OF this assembly DOT part OF this could be because donner didn T GET TO complete shooting the other part could be because the makers OF this project were intent ON USING AS little lester material AS possible DOT what we END up WITH IS an assembly OF footage that makes superman iv look airtight AND coherent DOT br br AFTER viewing this one gets the sense that WHILE lester was faithful AND comfortable USING donner material michael thau AND his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed BY lester DOT the best scenes IN the donner cut ARE the ones lifted relatively intact FROM the released VERSION OF superman ii DOT that includes the moon SEQUENCE AND the diner SEQUENCE NOT ironically BOTH were filmed BY donner DOT but anything ELSE FROM that movie filmed BY lester IS re edited IN such A hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem LIKE A ham fisted know NOTHING DOT WHILE lester honored the donner material lester here IS thrown UNDER the bus DOT br br so IS there anything good IN this RELEASE well marlon brando IS IN it AND that s neat TO see DOT IN fact watching ANY OF the material shot BY donner IS neat since it was ALL filmed AT the same TIME AS superman the movie DOT but that ONLY highlights the problems OF this RELEASE DOT ANY OF the major scenes really just lois jumping AND scenes WITH marlon brando would have been better served AS completed scenes IN A deleted scenes SECTION DOT INSTEAD they ARE shoe horned INTO A nonsensical narrative WITH inferior performances many alternate takes FROM familiar scenes ARE used sloppy edits AND bad decisions DOT br br watch the opening scene AT the daily planet DOT why ARE we looking AT jackie cooper s back AS he calls FOR lois AND clark AT the END why DO we have lois walking INTO her dark apartment ONLY TO have that followed BY jackie cooper walking INTO A dark bathroom turning the lights ON i was INITIALLY confused BY this because i expected TO see lois DOT the entire assembly IS filled WITH questionable choices LIKE this DOT br br battle scenes ARE A mess too WITH NO geography BETWEEN cuts DOT it s just random ACTION DOT OF course the major ACTION scenes were shot BY lester AND his material IS ONLY used AS A bridge TO the NEXT SET OF donner outtakes OR alternates DOT they should have used MORE OF lester s footage but probably had too much pride TO admit that DOT br br the sloppiness extends TO the military missile AS well DOT AS noted elsewhere the missile shown IN the donner cut bears the designation xk WHILE we ALL know it s the xk A blind man IN stm knows that the producers OF this assembly who tried so hard TO honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes IN AND that mistake IS indicative OF the quality OF the entire production DOT FOR ALL the supposed care that was put INTO this the FINAL product has an air OF shoddiness TO it that IS inescapable DOT br br the entire affair would probably be easier TO digest IF warner s didn T make this A separate RELEASE here IN the states DOT AS it IS we re expected TO pay FOR what IS essentially A bonus disc OF deleted scenes WITH A play ALL OPTION DOT it s really ONLY worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but AFTER that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet FOR dust AND little ELSE DOT i know AFTER my experience OF watching this i had NEW RESPECT FOR lester s VERSION DOT it s BY NO means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were IN the script that stand OUT here IN bold relief DOT he managed TO make A movie that has entertained FOR many years AND will CONTINUE TO DO so WHILE this NEW re cut will most likely ONLY be remembered AS A footnote IN that films history DOT,safe

series AND movies DOT AS far AS the series goes they DO A pretty good job IN bringing the fun AND magic OF the japanese versions TO television DOT so what IS their problem WHEN it comes TO the movies honestly now i have seen ALL three pokmon movies IN japanese AND i will definitely be seeing the fourth one DOT they ARE excellent movies DOT they ARE ALL enjoyable AND fun TO watch DOT AND AFTER seeing pokmon IN theaters i can T help but wonder how these american producers READ the japanese scripts DOT the way it appears it seems that they READ AND see something that says INSERT EMPTY moral here IN big bold faced letters DOT it definitely appears that way AS they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used ON msb extreme sarcasm there AND created this crap DOT br br possible spoilers FROM here ON br br well i guess i should FIRST talk about pikachu s rescue adventure DOT my FIRST gripe WITH this came WITH NO narration DOT i guess they got enough bad COMMENTS ON the pokdex narration that plagued pikachu s vacation AND INSTEAD OF going WITH A caring gentle woman s voice AS appeared IN pikachu NO natsu yasumi AND pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration ALL together DOT this wouldn T have been A problem EXCEPT FOR one thing DOT did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn T let togepi GO UNTIL the END possibly the fans but i M sure NOT the parents DOT THEN there s the theme song DOT i couldn T help but roll my eyes AT this one DOT the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou AND was sung BY japanese children DOT it was fun AND enjoyable DOT this one nauseating DOT now one OF my favorite parts OF the short was the dancing kireihana DOT nice music fun TO watch DOT that s changed WITH the bellossom DOT the music sucked FOR one but ON top OF that they had ALL the pokmon talk during the music which turned OUT TO be jumpy annoying AND just unnecessary DOT oh AND THEN there s the poliwhirl who thinks he s A poliwrath DOT you d think that guys that WORK WITH these CHARACTERS constantly would AT LEAST learn what they ARE DOT basically NOT much could save this little ill fated dub which IS very unfortunate considering its potential DOT but i haven T touched ON the worst OF it yet DOT br br you d think that the warning signs would ve been apparent TO me WHEN i received my issue OF nintendo POWER DOT FOR SOME unfathomable reason i had been PLACING SOME faith IN kids AND the wb DOT my thoughts were well they screwed up ON the FIRST movie but the SECOND IS different AS far AS the theme goes so they should DO well DOT that IN mind i just didn T pay attention TO the warning signs i encountered IN the theaters WHEN the trailers said you will believe that one person can make ALL the difference DOT WITH the way they said that AT EVERY turn i was hoping that this would NOT turn INTO A moral fest LIKE msb did AT the END OF the english VERSION DOT THEN comes nintendo POWER IN which i see ALL my fears realized IN the words the main feature the POWER OF one DOT AT that point i became A BIT MORE uneasy DOT the POWER OF one NOT A good sign DOT however i still kept SOME OF my FALSE faith DOT big mistake DOT br br sitting IN the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved IN japanese being turned INTO complete AND utter junk DOT i hear COMMENTS that say it was better because the moral was MORE subtle DOT i can see A point IN that since they didn T pander this thing repeating it OVER AND OVER LIKE IN msb DOT however it did MORE damage than anything ELSE IN this movie DOT FIRST OF ALL the legend that was READ throughout was changed A BIT TO READ the world turns TO ash DOT ah hah DOT so ash IS the chosen one whatever DOT IN the japanese VERSION the inhabitants OF arshia needed A pokmon trainer TO carry OUT their traditional ceremony DOT this TIME he s the chosen one DOT A greater way that this did damage was TO lugia DOT lugia was one OF the coolest CHARACTERS IN A pokmon movie DOT DOT DOT DOT WHEN the movie was about lugia DOT IN this one lugia IS forced TO take A back seat TO ash DOT IN the scene WHERE they re flying back TO the main island lugia AND ash ARE discussing the conditions OF lugia s existence NOT that ash IS going TO make ALL the difference DOT overall IN this category ash wasn T really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped BY many along the way DOT br br A lot OF the other stuff IS kind OF nit picking DOT furura s flute song wasn T nearly AS sweet AND enjoyable AS the japanese one DOT jirarudan s speech TO them saying his collection started WITH A mew card ugh DOT even worse misty s outrage originally concerned the way moltres AND zapdos were being held DOT why didn T you put them IN pokballs WHEN you caught them this IS LIKE caging them TO be displayed DOT much different FROM whining about him thinking pokmon ARE things TO be collected LIKE stamps DOT IF there were ANY REAL redeeming VALUES IN this they came FROM team rocket DOT SOME pretty funny lines DOT NOT really TO make me laugh OUT loud but MORE TO make me giggle AND slightly ease the pains IN my stomach DOT well that was officially the LAST american pokmon movie i M going TO see DOT i ve imported the third one AND find it very enjoyable DOT i would rather NOT see another japanese movie be ruined IN the same fashion AS the FIRST

DOT AND sometimes NOT even THEN DOT br br AS WITH ALL LONG running series they were numerous CAST changes DOT michael shanks LEFT the series IN january AT the END OF its fifth season IN ORDER TO broaden his horizons AS an actor DOT daniel jackson s successor AS the team s resident archaeologist geek was jonas quinn an alien FROM A country CALLED kelowna ON the planet langara played BY corin nemec DOT however shanks returned AT the beginning OF the seventh season IN june AND nemec LEFT AT the same TIME DOT unfortunately he made ONLY one further guest appearance AND his CHARACTER was seldom mentioned afterwards DOT don s DOT davis LEFT the series AT the END OF the seventh season IN march AS he felt that it was TIME FOR him TO GO DOT the SHOW s original star AND arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred IN the series throughout its FIRST eight seasons DOT his participation IN the seventh AND eight seasons was noticeably less than IN the earlier seasons DOT he finally LEFT sg IN march IN ORDER TO spend MORE TIME WITH his THEN six YEAR OLD daughter DOT jack o neill was BY far my favourite CHARACTER IN the series AND truth be told i never enjoyed the LAST two seasons AS much AS i did the earlier episodes FOR that very reason DOT br br the ninth season represented A NEW era FOR the programme DOT WITH the departure OF its LEAD actor AND the defeat OF the goa uld AND the replicators IN season eight many fans felt the series should GO OUT ON A high DOT regardless the series carried ON FOR A further two years WITH the ori replacing the goa uld AS the series main adversaries DOT three NEW CHARACTERS were brought IN TO fill the gaps AS it were AND help usher IN this re invention DOT ben browder came IN AS the cocky southern air FORCE pilot lt DOT colonel cameron mitchell the NEW leader OF sg DOT his farscape co star the lovely claudia black began TO play A prominent ROLE IN the series AS the vivacious sexy hilarious AND certainly extroverted vala mal doran A former goa uld host AND con artist FROM another planet DOT A recurring guest star during the eighth AND ninth seasons she joined the CAST FULL TIME AT the beginning OF its tenth AND FINAL season DOT rounding OFF the CAST was the legendary beau bridges AS major GENERAL hank landry the NEW commander OF the sgc AND an OLD friend OF jack o neill AND GENERAL hammond DOT FOR the LAST two years they starred alongside the sg faithful michael shanks amanda tapping AND christopher judge AND became valuable parts OF AND made equally valuable contributions TO the stargate franchise DOT br br alas ALL good things must come TO an END DOT during the initial broadcast OF the FIRST several episodes OF season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting IN cancellation IN its august DOT AFTER ten seasons AND episodes the dream was finally OVER DOT ON march what began WITH children OF the gods ended WITH unending DOT the series finale made its world premiere ON sky one IN britain AND ireland BEFORE being shown ON the sci fi channel IN the united states ON june DOT br br IN the ten years that the series was ON the air it amassed legions OF fans AND even eclipsed the science fiction series star trek IN terms OF popularity IN certain countries DOT it became the SECOND longest running sci fi series IN the world SECOND ONLY TO doctor who AND the longest running american produced sci fi series HAVING surpassed the x files ONLY A few months BEFORE it ended DOT br br stargate sg represents the cornerstone OF the stargate franchise DOT IN its success AND popularity led TO the production OF A spin OFF series entitled stargate atlantis which was regrettably cancelled AFTER five seasons AND episodes IN august DOT although PLANS FOR another feature film fell through two direct TO dvd films stargate the ark OF truth AND stargate continuum were released IN AND MORE ARE planned FOR the NOT too distant future DOT A third live ACTION series stargate universe IS ALSO due TO premiere AT SOME point NEXT YEAR DOT there was unfortunately an animated series stargate infinity which ran ONLY FROM TO but the less said about that the better DOT despite the END OF sg AND atlantis AS continuing series the future OF stargate looks very bright indeed DOT br br IN conclusion WHILE stargate has yet TO gain the same DEGREE OF popular recognition AS other major sci fi television

493,WHEN sam peckinpah s superlative the wild bunch opened the door TO outrageous displays OF graphic cinematic ultra violence it did so WITH A talented IF whisky marinated hand guiding the camera AND had A compelling story WITH CHARACTERS who had actual DEPTH but IN NO TIME flat there were scores OF imitators that fell far FROM the benchmark SET BY peckinpah s epic AND soldier blue definitely falls INTO that category DOT br br soldier blew er blue tells the story OF foul mouthed NEW yorker cresta lee candice bergen A blonde proto hippie chick who s been rescued FROM two years OF captivity among the cheyenne AND IS now being sent TO A fort WHERE she ll be reunited WITH the fiance she ONLY wants TO marry FOR his money DOT ALSO ON board the wagon she s traveling IN IS A shipment OF government gold cash the cheyenne need TO buy guns WITH so IN short ORDER the soldiers ARE wiped OUT AND cresta flees TO the hills accompanied BY honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman DOT calling gant BY the snarky nickname soldier blue cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was TIME well spent outstripping gant IN survival skills common sense AND sheer balls AND OVER their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements A band OF hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played BY donald pleasance here giving one OF his most ridiculous performances AND that s saying something AND IN the tradition OF many previous western SET romantic comedies EACH other DOT br br during the course OF their misadventures the two opposites ARE inevitably AND predictably attracted TO EACH other AND eventually END up getting it ON WHILE gant has A freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg NO less IN what was surely the ONLY conveniently located cave FOR AT LEAST A twelve mile radius that wasn T filled WITH rattlesnakes mountain lions OR who knows what TO say NOTHING OF the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy WITH such A primo apartment there i GO thinking IN nyc REAL estate terms again DOT br br realizing that their love could never flourish outside OF the cave cresta leaves gant AND makes it TO the fort BY herself ONLY TO discover that the moron IN charge won T spare A couple OF men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs ALL available personnel TO launch an attack ON the nearby cheyenne village AND once cresta gets wind OF that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby TO be AND makes A beeline straight TO the cheyenne TO warn them OF what s coming DOT br br what happens NEXT IS what gained the film its infamy it turns OUT that ALL the wacky misadventures AND squabbling were ALL just A LEAD IN TO A hideous reenactment OF the sand creek massacre an orgy OF rape torture AND GENERAL sadistic evil perpetrated IN the NAME OF keeping the country clean AND almost forty years AFTER its RELEASE this SEQUENCE still disturbs AND nauseates FOR its sheer cruelty DOT children ARE trampled beneath the hooves OF charging horses OR impaled ON bayonets unarmed people ARE beheaded A nice effect i have TO admit women ARE stripped AND pawed BY gangs OF slavering brutes THEN raped AND mutilated IN one truly sickening INSTANCE A naked native woman puts up too much OF A fight so her rapist INSTEAD decides TO cut OFF her breasts which we thankfully ONLY see the START OF BEFORE the camera moves ON TO chronicle SOME other hideous act AND scores OF innocent people ARE shot AND dismembered their compone nt parts impaled ON pikes AND waved about IN victorious celebration OR kept AS the most ghoulish OF souvenirs DOT NO joke this scene would instantly garner an nc rating IF released today TO say NOTHING OF possibly spurring native american interest GROUPS TO riot IN the streets OVER the incredibly exploitative manner IN which the atrocities ARE depicted DOT br br i M ALL IN favor OF westerns that don T shy away FROM honest portrayals OF how the west was won OR stolen IF truth be told but this film has NO idea OF what kind OF movie it wants TO be one MINUTE it s A heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment OF the natives was totally effed up well duh THEN it s A light hearted battle OF the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant IS AND manages TO look hot IN her tasty red calico poncho WITH NO undies but that ALL goes OUT the WINDOW WHEN donald pleasance shows up WITH an unintentionally hilarious pair OF buck toothed dentures AND our heroes must figure OUT how TO ESCAPE FROM his murderous clutches IN A sub plot that goes nowhere ALL OF which culminates IN the aforementioned apocalyptic climax DOT ANY one OF those tacks would have been okay FOR A coherent film but the END RESULT IS A slapdash mess that milked the horrors OF its FINAL ten minutes FOR ALL they were worth IN the film s promotion AND poster imagery DOT br br but BY trying TO be ALL things TO ALL audiences soldier blue ends up AS an incoherent preachy mulligan stew OF presumably well intentioned political correctness but IF they were going TO tell the story OF the sand creek massacre wouldn T it have been A good idea TO have SOME indian CHARACTERS who were MORE than just walk ons WITH murphy brown acting AS their mouthpiece we GET TO know absolutely NOTHING OF the people who GET wiped OUT solely FOR what appears TO be A crass ploy TO lure gorehound

575,i saw this movie IN the theater WHEN i was A kid AND ALWAYS remember it AS my FIRST experience WITH getting ripped OFF BY A horrible movie WITH A good commercial DOT the commercial was great but it i FOUND OUT later that it had EVERY explosion OR special effect IN the entire movie about AND even SOME that weren T IN the movie DOT there was SOME sort OF plot relating TO the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown IN the movie AS far AS i remember DOT it was clearly A CASE OF someone making A buck OFF A cheap movie designed TO scam people DOT i guess my world OF innocence ended that DAY WHEN i FOUND OUT there were bad people OUT there who make bad bad movies DOT,safe
576,my rating refers TO the FIRST seasons OF stargate sg which ARE wonderfully fresh creative AND addicting DOT WHEN the CAST stepped through the gate you never knew what lay ON the other side starting around season the SHOW took A different focus still good but different DOT br br the series follows the adventures OF A team OF humans AND one alien who regularly venture INTO A planetary transport device CALLED the stargate DOT the backstory OF the series IS based ON the CHARACTERS AND events OF the movie stargate IN which the device IS discovered during an archaeological dig IN egypt DOT br br the episodes ARE light innocent AND easy TO watch AND very creative DOT many OF the inventive stories could easily have been made INTO great sci fi movies OF their own DOT what happens NEXT was ALWAYS unpredictable DOT br br the CHARACTERS ON which the SHOW rests ARE ALSO well DEFINED AND brilliantly performed DOT their tone IS serious but the dialog IS flowered WITH incredible wit AND humor DOT they ARE simply fun TO watch DOT br br starting somewhere around season the series started TO evolve INTO A continuing storyline based ON fighting A single foe the goa uld THEN the ori DOT the plots become MORE complex A lot MORE political strategic oriented AND interdependent DOT the CHARACTERS were still AS great AS ever but the SHOW was different IN nature DOT br br one thing that must be mentioned IS TO watch the episodes that commemorated the th AND th episodes DOT they ARE simply can T miss shows DOT they exhibit the creative AND wildly humorous genius that carried the series through seasons DOT br br IF you ARE A sci fi fan watch A few episodes OF the FIRST seasons AND you ll likely be hooked DOT IF you LIKE evolving story lines BETWEEN two opposing sides you have seasons OF shows TO look FORWARD TO DOT,safe
577,that IS the ONLY question i am LEFT WITH DOT why did this movie suck so much WHEN it had such A great CAST why was the writing so bad it LEFT the audience completely unconnected WITH the CHARACTERS why did it NOT make ANY sense AT ALL why did the studio take A perfectly good premise AND hollywood the hell OUT OF it WHEN ALL it needed was good smart story telling why i never understand why movies that START OUT good turn INTO A pile OF crap BY the TIME they re released DOT i hope FOR the sake OF freeman an spacey who ARE oscar winners that this never IS released TO the big screens IN america DOT br br AS someone that holds A bachelors DEGREE IN journalism the whole story IS just utterly laughable DOT i just DOT DOT DOT think the script had potential but the execution turned it INTO A clich AND an awful one AT that DOT just DOT NO DOT,safe

580,FIRST OFF this IS NOT supposed TO be A brilliant AND thought provoking film LIKE so many other reviewers seem TO compare it TO DOT the FIRST review says something along the lines OF anyone who likes this knows NOTHING about horror cinema apparently its the other way around DOT IF one were TO look back AFTER the film it really wasn T meant TO be convincing it was A low budget ipecac DOT but really thats ALL it was aiming FOR it was meant TO blow viewers away WITH sheer shock VALUE AND ALL the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back IN the original vhs versions DOT br br i gave this one A high score because it reached its goal AND even though it was NOT downright horrific IN non shock sense it did make me slightly sick AND thoroughly paranoid pessimistic i didn T trust anyone FOR about A week because i didn T want TO wake up strung up AND tortured,safe

583,now i flicked onto this just OUT OF curiosity AND had TO keep watching IN the same way that you watch A car crash DOT DOT DOT br br i appreciate the fact it s A spoof but that should NOT stop me FROM criticising the god awful directing acting AND dialogue DOT seriously this rated AS one OF the poorest movies i have seen it looked MORE LIKE an episode OF tales FROM the cryptkeeper AND A poor one AT that DOT DOT DOT br br okay A few criticisms WHEN the doctor had his heart attack IN front OF the monster we never see the monster attack him so we assume its A heart attack the army THEN launch shells rockets bullets AT the monster which was feet FROM the doctor yet the doctor IS NOT touched BY ANY missile AND IS still alive the army attack FROM about yards away AND we see A flame thrower being used geez those things have A RANGE OF NO MORE than metres WHEN the monster tries TO take the professor the soldiers run INTO the classroom AND fire INTO the CEILING the monster drops the kid AND the soldiers don T try TO shoot the monster come ON the monster looks LIKE it something OUT OF POWER rangers there IS one scene WHERE the five good guys the priest the girl the doctor the reporter AND the kid ALL look shocked AND we GET reactions along the lines OF hand TO mouth one AFTER the other so NATURAL the GENERAL just runs away TIME AFTER TIME the GENERAL refuses TO try electricity AND wouldn T LISTEN the acting IS awful did i mention the rubber suit monster that god awful music non stop,safe

585,YES the southern star features A pretty forgettable title tune sung BY that heavy SET crooner matt monro DOT it pretty much establishes the tone FOR this bloated AND rather dull feature stunningly miscast WITH george segal AND ursula andress AS an adventurous couple IN SEARCH OF A LARGE diamond DOT ADD IN harry andrews WITH A strange accent NO less chasing an ostrich tons OF stock footage OF wildlife AND poorly composed AND dull photography BY raoul coutard AND you END up WITH A thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles OF senegal DOT,safe

659,WHEN A movie OF A book seems pointless AND incomprehensible the cause can invariably be FOUND IN the book either it was pointless TO START WITH OR the point IS one NOT easily conveyed TO film OR the movie missed the point which IS the most frequent OF these results AND the easiest TO happen especially WHEN the point IS one NOT easily DEFINED DOT the book morvern callar has A point EVERY reader OF the book must have felt this AND felt AS IF he had gotten it but i suspect most OF them could NOT STATE it IN words DOT i M NOT sure i can myself but perhaps it comes TO this OR something LIKE it things come things GO such IS life but we carry ON OR AT ANY rate SOME OF us people LIKE morvern DO DOT NO doubt A MORE erudite critic could construct A MORE adequate definition DOT but the important fact IS that there IS A point possibly the SUM OF the entire story IS the point AND that this would have been the main thing TO keep IN VIEW AND TO carry OVER IN adapting the story TO film DOT the maker OF this film evidently missed the point AND doesn T substitute one OF her own AND so the film IS about NOTHING DOT br br this IS NOT the usual complaint OF A book lover that his favorite TEXT has been violated DOT the merit OF the book IS something i conceded grudgingly IN reading it i FOUND it A bloody nuisance AND an occasion FOR kicking the author IN the pants AND getting him IN TO finish the job properly DOT the narrative IS supposed TO be the WORK OF the half educated morvern but that illusion IS constantly dispelled BY A dozen different TYPES OF literary effect AS IF the author were poking AT her WITH his pen there ARE inconsistencies OF STYLE AND tone AS IF different sections had been composed AT different times AND ANY conclusions i could reach about morvern had TO remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended AND which he did NOT FOR INSTANCE despite morvern s own SELF characterization AS A raver am i wrong that IN the END she remains essentially A working CLASS scots girl AND beneath her wrapping OF music downloads NOT so different FROM those OF generations past IN ANY CASE despite my irritation AT the author i couldn T deny that his book stuck WITH me AND what i couldn T GET OUT OF my head was his CHARACTER s attitude her angle ON the world which was almost AS vivid AS A goya portrait DOT morvern IS the kind OF person who s ALWAYS encountering situations AT once rather comic AND rather horrible occasionally she invites them but MORE often they land ON her LIKE flies so that much OF her life consists OF A kind OF gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical AND unconsciously philosophical AND that doesn T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE it idiosyncratically enough DOT the complex OF incidents AND OF morvern s responses TO them ARE the substance OF the book AND its achievement IN exposing A CROSS SECTION OF existence it would be difficult TO illuminate otherwise FOR ALL my dislike OF the book i can see this DOT br br the morvern just described IS NOT the morvern OF the movie OR IF it IS most OF her IS kept offscreen DOT an actress who might have been A good fit FOR the CHARACTER had she been

movies jesus son she played A girl who WITH A few adjustments could have been turned INTO this one DOT unfortunately AS the film turned OUT she doesn T have the CHARACTER FROM the book TO play DOT FOR one thing the book IS one that IF it IS TO be dramatized virtually cries OUT FOR monologues BY the main CHARACTER TO the audience WITHOUT her COMMENTS her perspective her voice the story loses most OF its meaning DOT it has lost MORE OF it IN that the adaptor has expurgated it OF its comic AND horrible elements the most memorable incidents FROM the book ARE curtailed BEFORE they turn grotty AND so morvern s responses whether OF amusement OR distaste depending ON her mood ARE missing too AND the incidents NO longer have A reason FOR being IN the story DOT IN short the filmmaker chose FOR SOME reason TO turn A brisk edgy serio comic novel INTO A genteel art tv film AND chose AS her typical image one OF ms DOT morton languishing IN A artistically shaded melancholy AS IF the outing morvern signs up FOR were A tour OF the stations OF the CROSS DOT this isn T AT ALL what the book OR the morvern OF the book was about DOT FOR another thing the morvern OF the movie isn T scottish the actress said IN an interview she hadn T had TIME TO study up the accent AND she ought TO be it s important that she her FAMILY AND her mates ARE ALL FROM A single place DOT AND finally the film IS missing the END OF the story morvern s spending ALL she has AND coming home TO icy darkness it s winter the dam has frozen the POWER has gone OUT AND the pub IS dark DOT minus this AND minus ALL OF the rest what s LEFT IS A failed art film A dead film about A subject whose strength lay precisely IN her refusal OR native inability ever TO give IN TO being dead DOT,safe

691,lorenzo lamas stars AS SOME TYPE OF cia agent who captures SOME exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter AND forces her TO fight her former employers DOT o DOT j simpson IS ALSO ON board TO provide A dash OF acting credibility FOR the NOT so talented ensemble DOT i must admit i M NOT A fan OF lorenzo lamas OR his movies DOT he stinks DOT however WHEN compared TO o DOT j simpson AND lamas comatose wife kinmont lamas seems LIKE ah jean claude van damme DOT i ONLY saw cia because OF the renewed interest around the o DOT j simpson trial you see because IF your parents had cable AND the extra channels you couldn T ESCAPE this movie DOT IN you could GO TO an amish community AND SOME moron would have this playing IN their portable tv DOT the movie itself IS A collection OF lame ACTION SEQUENCES AND would be intrigue although the shock VALUE OF o DOT j simpson jumping AFTER fireballs AND exchanging would be one liners DO provide SOME unintentional humor DOT ALSO WHERE was bobby knight AND kobe bryant TO make this A complete camp classic br br OUT OF bad,safe
692,jim carrey IS back TO much the same ROLE that he played IN the mask A timid guy who IS trying TO GET ahead IN the world but who seems TO be plagued WITH bad luck DOT even WHEN he tries TO help A homeless guy FROM being harassed BY A bunch OF hoodlums AND OF course they have TO be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires DOT IN that CASE it wasn T too hard TO predict that he was about TO have A handful OF angry hoodlums but i LIKE that the movie suggests that things LIKE that shouldn T be ignored DOT i M reminded OF the episode OF michael moore s brilliant the awful truth WHEN they had A man lay down ON the sidewalk AND pretend TO be dead AND see who would actually stop AND make sure he was okay DOT the results were NOT very promising so it s nice TO see someone IN the movies setting A good example DOT br br jim carrey plays the part OF bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems TO be falling apart DOT OR even better it seems TO be breaking up BY the blows OF bad luck LIKE an asteroid entering the atmosphere A little metaphor that comes up WHEN bruce miraculously finds himself A gigantic news story later IN the film DOT bruce IS nearly years OLD AND ALL he has TO SHOW FOR it IS A POSITION AS A news reporter OF the sort that reports ON such exciting news AS the LOCAL bakery that s seeking TO bake the world s biggest cookie DOT he s desperate TO obtain the job OF head anchor AT the tv station but he loses his cool ON live tv WHEN he hears that the job went TO his rival colleague DOT you have TO love how they TIME the revelation OF this news TO him seconds BEFORE his FIRST live report DOT needless TO say he loses his temper ON live tv IN one OF the funniest scenes OF the entire film DOT br br morgan freeman delivers A fantastic performance AS the man himself displaying A god whose infinite wisdom IS somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent AS an actor DOT he IS the kind OF god who takes his job very seriously but IN such A way AS TO advise his followers AS well AS the viewers OF this movie that there ARE times WHEN you need TO slow down AND DO SOME manual labor IN life DOT i love his line that SOME OF the happiest people IN the world come home smelling TO high heaven AT the END OF the DAY DOT there ARE A lot OF people IN the world maybe MORE than our SHARE IN america who ARE so absorbed BY their money AND their possessions AND their jobs AND everything that they completely lost touch WITH the NATURAL side OF themselves AS humans DOT br br one OF the biggest strengths IS that the movie IS able TO provide great advice TO people IN GENERAL about improving their lives AND this message IS clear AND acceptable regardless OF the viewer s religion DOT i FOR example tend TO reject organized religion IN ALL forms AND i see god AND satan TO be metaphors FOR different aspects OF nature AND human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived OR CONTINUE TO live DOT but despite the fact that i don T believe that god EXISTS AS an entity overseeing the universe OR AS A janitor dressed ALL IN white who mops the floors OF his downtown office IN his spare TIME i was able TO appreciate the messages that were delivered IN this movie DOT br br jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that TIES them ALL together AND makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come DOT IF you compare bruce almighty WITH movies LIKE ace ventura BOTH OF which i loved BY the way OR A lot OF what he did BEFORE he got INTO film it s amazing how far he s come DOT he has moved FROM cheesy tv comedy TO cheesy comedic films TO comedies that ARE truly intelligent AND meaningful LIKE this film AS well AS OTHERS LIKE the truman SHOW man ON the moon AND the majestic easily one OF his GREATEST films ever DOT jim carrey has unmistakably moved FROM the cheesy comedy OF his past TO become one OF the most important comic actors working today DOT br br jennifer aniston ALSO once again provides an excellent addition TO the movie AS she did IN the side splitting office SPACE AS bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated BY bruce s growing stress about his life AS well AS his negligence TO ask her TO marry him DOT there IS definitely SOME low brow comedy IN the film that doesn T really fit WITH the importance OF the film s meaning OR the quality OF the delivery such AS the dog reading the newspaper ON the toilet AND the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice TO see ace ventura s friend spike make A cameo appearance DOT AS stephen king very well knows it s ALWAYS nice TO see familiar CHARACTERS DOT it s almost LIKE seeing FAMILY again DOT br br bruce IS endowed WITH the powers OF god FOR A given PERIOD OF TIME so that he can understand life A BIT better AND he says A lot about himself WHEN he uses the powers ONLY FOR his own purposes rather than TO help ALL OF the people who pray TO him DOT the thing i love about this IS that LIKE i said BEFORE religion IS ABSENT FROM my life but i was able TO watch this AND learn A lot about myself AS well BY thinking about what kinds OF things i would have done had i been endowed WITH such powers DOT the movie allows us TO learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even MORE DOT br br the scenes that involve the news station ARE easily the funniest IN the entire film such AS the scene WHEN bruce loses his temper about the anchor POSITION the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried WITH an original birth certificate AND A complete SET OF dental records the scene WHERE bruce s rival colleague IS made TO GO nuts ON camera AND my favorites the ones AT the beginning AND the END involving the LOCAL bakery s cooking DOT the movie has plenty OF TIME FOR carrey TO deliver SOME excellent jokes such AS WHEN he says TO god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be REAL bashes AND TO be careful about drinking because ON OF him might need A ride home i ALSO loved the END WHEN he says that behind EVERY great man IS A woman rolling her eyes DOT A little too TRUE AND AS gallagher would ADD behind EVERY great man IS ALSO an amazed mother IN law DOT br br bruce almighty IS one OF the MORE memorable comedies TO have come OUT FOR quite A WHILE AND IS probably the ONLY directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious TO buy ON dvd TO ADD TO my personal collection DOT it IS A comedy written AND performed IN good taste but WITH enough relatively low brow humor TO keep the kids entertained DOT this IS A meaningful comedy FOR the whole FAMILY which IS becoming rarer AND rarer these days DOT IN A world that IS about TO be flogged WITH yet another american pie film AND another scary movie which ARE ONLY scary because OF their sheer barbarous idiocy it s nice TO see that there ARE still people making comedies worth watching DOT don T miss this one DOT,safe

696,china o brien was an attempt TO make cynthia rothrock A star IN the united states DOT this golden harvet production was helmed BY veteran director robert clouse DOT sadly he was either lucky WITH enter the dragon OR he s lost his touch because he s NOT that great OF A director DOT the ONLY reason TO watch this movie IS TO see the fighting skills OF ms DOT rothrock AND richard norton DOT IF this movie was directed BY corey yuen OR hoi meng it could have been an ACTION classic INSTEAD OF A cheesy straight TO video ACTION flick DOT br br china o brien RETURNS home TO help OUT her dad DOT he s HAVING trouble WITH the LOCAL mob AND he needs her help DOT so she RETURNS home AND restores ORDER WITH the help OF two unlikely people DOT but will they be enough TO topple mister big AND his evil cronies br br IF you re A big cynthia rothrock fan THEN this movie s catered FOR you DOT i ONLY enjoyed the fighting scenes everything ELSE IS rubbish DOT why didn T raymond chow shell OUT A few shekels AND hired A top notch ACTION director br br recommended DOT,safe
697,this film was hard TO GET A HOLD OF AND WHEN i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming DOT i mean this IS one OF the great stories OF the twentieth century an UNKNOWN man takes advantage OF the unsuspecting airline industry AND gets away WITH millions IN ransom WITHOUT hurting anyone OR bungling the attempt DOT WITH ALL OF this built IN interest how could anyone make such A lackluster talk laden flick OF this TRUE life EVENT DOT WHILE williams IS ALWAYS interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d DOT b DOT cooper persona was stereotypically heroic LIKE A movie star s what we GET IS A TYPE WITHOUT ANY engaging details OR insights INTO the mind OF A person daring enough AND clever enough TO have pulled it OFF DOT harrold practically steals the movie WITH her spunk AND pure beauty but the REAL letdown was IN the handling OF the plot AND the lame direction DOT shame ON this film FOR even existing DOT,safe
698,this one AND her pilgrim soul ARE two OF my favorite episodes IN this NEW VERSION OF twilight ZONE DOT AS i mentioned IN my COMMENT ON the NEW series there s something lacking IN this NEW series DOT maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has TO be learned DOT it s A little BIT MORE mawkish AND sentimental than serling s VERSION DOT however this episode can be considered AS quite sentimental too DOT i think the appeal IS that NO matter what they DO the lovers can never unite DOT i remember i wasn T surprised BY the korean movie il mare later remade INTO the lake house DOT i think it s because i saw this episode FIRST so it ruined the impact OF the later film DOT,safe

mediums that were ancestral TO them DOT obviously the newspaper comic STRIP was one parent providing the visual narrative METHOD OF story telling DOT br br the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine DOT the inexpensive prose story publications that carried A great deal OF stories OF the same adventure CHARACTERS IN ON going though NOT necessarily serialized tales DOT the pulp medium had been around FOR SOME decades AND introduced us TO edgar rice borrough s tarzan AND johnston mcculley s zorro DOT the s brought forth A bumper crop AS feature CHARACTERS LIKE the shadow the avenger G s

752,i saw A trailer FOR this ON afro promo the collection OF movie trailers FOR movies featuring african americans DOT it looked LIKE what it IS A highly tendentious wacky comedy IN which an uptight black man realizes that his son IS gay DOT it would seem that redd foxx s rf wife has LEFT him FOR his brother who works WITH him AT the store back IN phoenix DOT he has taken the bus TO visit his son norman IS los angeles DOT br br so AS rf arrives norman wearing NOTHING but powder blue bikini shorts gets OUT OF his waterbed TO answer the door DOT trying TO buy TIME BY making his elderly father take the stairs TO what appears TO be the th FLOOR norman tries TO wake his lover who steadfastly refuses TO budge DOT it was just TO the point WHERE i wrote why won T he wake up WHEN suddenly he does AND me AND my friend s jaws dropped FOR the FIRST OF many times AS we ARE presented WITH our FIRST glimpse OF the blue eyed swirl hairdoed garson norman s white live IN lover who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream garson IS A flaming queen OF A TYPE that can ONLY be imagined AS emerging FROM l DOT A DOT he has dresses AND A purse AND big clunky jewelry AND seems TO have modeled BOTH his look AND persona ON carol brady FROM the brady bunch DOT br br norman orders his lover TO find somewhere ELSE TO stay during his father s visit DOT garson goes TO stay WITH waylon flowers AND madam answers the phone WHEN norman calls DOT br br so rf attempts TO reach his wife IN mexico DOT WHILE he IS ON the phone garson comes IN TO pack his dress AND rf confronts him DOT WITH A burst OF s soul music meant TO evoke his dawning revelation but sounding MORE LIKE we re about TO hear A very special track BY the emotions he realizes that his son IS gay DOT br br his FIRST impulse IS i ll kill him DOT i ll kill him DOT THEN rf goes ON A LONG walk wherein he cycles through ALL OF the thoughts A confused parent might have such AS maybe we toilet trained him too soon DOT his thoughts ARE ALL triggered BY something he sees ON his walk FOR INSTANCE A burly truck driver appearing just AS he IS contemplating what makes A REAL man DOT surprisingly he goes TO A bookstore AND buys about eight books ON homosexuality DOT this it must be said IS about eight MORE books ON homosexuality than my parents bought DOT he THEN goes straight TO A park bench AND READS them ALL br br rf THEN hires audrey A six foot amazon prostitute IN this amazing fur thing played BY tamara dobson OF cleopatra jones DOT he hired her FOR norman TO try OUT heterosexuality but this pisses norman AND he storms OUT TO GO stay WITH his friend melody DOT br br THEN garson comes OVER AND offers TO take rf OUT FOR the night DOT he commiserates OVER the loss OF rf s wife AND tells the tale OF his own mother who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because she was molested AT A luau DOT they attend A LONG featured performance OF wayon AND madam which culminates IN madam violently bashing her head against the piano UNTIL her hair comes loose DOT once MORE mouths were agape DOT br br so it seems that wouldn T ya just know it rf AND garson have A wonderful evening together you see staid traditional older black men just have TO see the crappy highly effeminate entertainment OF mega queens IN ORDER TO come around TO ALL the gay world has TO offer it s really just that SIMPLE this still does NOT prevent rf FROM yelling rape WHEN garson wakes him FROM A bad dream DOT it ends less predictably than you d think DOT br br there was so much that was just OFF DOT what IS the basis OF norman AND garson s relationship they don T seem TO have ANY rapport AND norman has NO qualms whatsoever about kicking garson OUT AND even WHEN he comes around TO stand up FOR himself he never defends garson OR talks about their relationship DOT there were SOME kind OF sweetly quaint touches LIKE rf going TO buy ALL those books ON homosexuality AND sitting RIGHT down ON the park bench TO READ them i LIKE the idea that A parent would actually try TO find something OUT about homosexuality rather than just run OFF TO GET drunk OR commiserate WITH his friends DOT br br other than that it s kind OF just what it seems LIKE A little relic OF A bygone era an era IN which SOME gay people thought that IF uptight straight people just sat down AND watched A drag marionette performance we could ALL learn TO love AND understand one another AND because OF the whole naivet OF this thing the extreme stereotypes AND message laden dialogue just come OFF AS charmingly outdated AND provide A great deal OF grist FOR discussion ON how things have changed FOR gays IN the past years DOT i guess the ONLY thing that seems offensive IS the idea that gays female friends ARE desperately IN love WITH them AND ARE willing

774,this IS one OF those movies that made me feel strongly FOR the need OF making movies AT ALL DOT generally speaking i am A fan OF movies based ON worthy TRUE stories DOT AND this one IS great besides meryl s performance which has gained A lot OF recognition AND praise the movie s GREATEST asset IS the story it IS based ON DOT the riveting tale OF A couple who suffer social AND legal torture AFTER HAVING undergone enormous emotional pain AT the unexpected AND brutal death OF their infant child IS really an eye opening fable that exposes the inhumane side OF fellow humans AND uncovers the barbarism OF A very refined AND lawful society DOT it IS interesting TO see how people who consider themselves AS kind AND intelligent people the emotional jury ladies IN the movie FOR example ARE IN reality NOTHING MORE than selfish dupes who would FOR their dogmatic beliefs AND prejudices shut their brains TO ANY deliberation AND contemplation even IN the light OF ALL facts pointing very clearly against their opinions DOT the other face OF the so CALLED civilized society that the movie exposes IS the apathy TO the pain OF fellow human beings needless TO say this IS very GENERAL even though this SPECIFIC tale unfolds IN australia that goes AS far AS becoming A TRUE cruelty DOT must see IF you ARE willing TO take something serious AND perhaps thought provoking DOT,safe

form the FAMILY tent BY A dingo just moments AFTER being put down DOT br br amid media speculation AND vicious PUBLIC rumour lindy was charged WITH the murder OF her baby AND michael was charged AS an accessory AFTER the fact DOT what followed was little MORE than trial BY media AND WITH the australian people determined she be put away lindy was FOUND guilty AND sentenced TO life imprisonment WITH

855,AT the beginning OF the film you might DOUBLE CHECK the dvd cover AND re READ the synopsis A couple OF times but NO worries DOT it s NOT memoirs OF A geisha that you purchased just A movie WITH an intro that IS much MORE classy AND stylish than it has ANY RIGHT TO be DOT still the opening IS BY far the best thing about the entire movie AS it shows how IN the YEAR A samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery DOT he decapitates the two lovers BEFORE doing SOME hara kiri ritual suicide through disembowelment DOT cut TO present DAY WHEN the american ambassador IN japan welcomes A befriended FAMILY AND drives them up TO the same house WHERE the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one AND A half century ago DOT FROM THEN onwards this becomes A seemingly ROUTINE haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded AND implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional DOT let s START WITH the good aspects namely the original japanese setting AND the presence OF the delicious susan george who IS my ALL TIME favorite british horror wench well together WITH britt eckland linda hayden AND ingrid pitt DOT the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay IS incoherent imbecilic beyond repair AND FULL OF supposedly unsettling twists that ONLY evoke laughter DOT the restless spirits OF the house soon BEGIN TO entertain themselves BY perpetrating INTO the bodies OF the NEW tenants AND causing them TO DO AND say ALL sorts OF crazy stuff DOT the spirit OF the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing INTO susan s ravishing booty AND transforming her INTO A lewd seductress IN this possessed STATE she even lures the american ambassador outside TO have sex IN the garden OF A high society diner party FULL OF prominent guests DOT so strictly spoken it s NOT really evil that dwells IN the house just A trio OF sleazy ghosts WITH dirty minds AND far too much FREE TIME ON their LONG dead hands obviously these scenes ARE MORE comical than frightening especially since the light blue AND transparent shapes remind you OF the cute ghost effects that were later popularized IN ghostbusters DOT the house WHERE evil dwells IS probably the LEAST scary ghost movie ever DOT throughout most OF the running TIME you ll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell AND FROM beyond the grave intentionally wanted TO make his movie funny AND OVER the top LIKE motel hell maybe DOT but THEN again everyone IN the CAST continues TO speak his her lines WITH A straight AND sincere face so i guess we ARE nevertheless supposed TO take everything seriously AND feel disturbed DOT the house WHERE evil dwells IS never suspenseful OR even remotely exciting AND it doesn T even contain ANY grisly images apart FROM the massacre AT the beginning DOT i am fully aware OF how shallow it sounds but the two scenes IN which susan george goes topless ARE the ONLY TRUE highlights DOT well those AND maybe ALSO the invasion OF cheesy AND ridiculously OVER sized spiders OR ARE they crabs IN the daughter s bedroom DOT how totally random AND irrelevant was that IF you ever decide TO give this movie A chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you LEAVE your common sense AND reasoning AT the doorstep DOT br br trivia note FOR horror buffs keep an eye OPEN FOR the demon mask that was ALSO A pivot piece OF scenery IN the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba DOT,safe

857,this could have been interesting A japan SET haunted house story FROM the viewpoint OF A newly installed american FAMILY but falls flat due TO an OVER simplified treatment AND the unsuitability OF BOTH CAST AND director DOT br br the film suffers FROM the same problem i often encounter WITH the popular modern renaissance OF such native fare i DOT e DOT the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves TO be evil FOR NO REAL reason other than that they re expected TO besides it doesn T deliver much IN the scares department A giant crab attack IS merely silly AS generally the ghosts inhabit A SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND cause him OR her TO act IN A totally uncharacteristic way such AS susan george seducing diplomat friend OF the FAMILY doug mcclure AND edward albert FORCE feeding his daughter A bowl OF soup br br AT one point an OLD monk turns up AT the house TO warn albert OF the danger IF they remain there eventually he s CALLED upon TO exorcise the premises DOT however history IS bound TO REPEAT itself AND tragedy IS the ONLY outcome OF the tense situation duly created LEADING TO A violent yet unintentionally funny climax IN which albert AND mcclure possessed BY the spirits OF their japanese predecessors engage IN an impromptu karate duel TO the death AT the END OF the DAY this emerges an innocuous TIME waster tolerable AT just minutes but IN NO way essential viewing DOT,safe
858,HAVING READ SOME OF the other COMMENTS here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised DOT reality CHECK the original series wasn T that good DOT i think SOME people remember it WITH MORE affection than it deserved but apart FROM the car chases AND daisy duke s legs the scripts were weak AND poorly acted DOT the duke boys were too intelligent AND posh FOR backwood hicks the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous TO be evil AND rosco was just hyper throughout EVERY screen moment DOT it s amazing the series actually lasted AS LONG AS it did because it ran OUT OF story lines during the FIRST series DOT br br back TO the movie DOT IF you watch this film IN it s own RIGHT NOT AS A direct comparison TO however you remember the tv series THEN it s NOT bad AT ALL DOT the REAL star IS OF course the GENERAL lee DOT the car chases AND stunts ARE excellent AND that s really what d DOT o DOT h DOT IS ALL about DOT johnny knoxville IS his usual eccentric SELF AND along WITH seann william scott AS cousin bo the pair make this film really funny IN A hilarious dumb AND dumber sort OF way the tv series never achieved DOT the lovely jessica simpson IS A natch AS miss daisy burt reynolds makes A much improved boss hog AND M DOT C DOT gainey makes A believably nasty rosco P DOT coltrane the way he ALWAYS should have been DOT br br IF you don T LIKE slapstick humour AND crazy car stunts THEN you wouldn T be watching this film anyway because you should know what TO expect DOT otherwise IF you want an entertaining car ACTION movie WITH A few good laughs that s NOT too taxing ON the brain THEN GO see this enjoyable romp WITH an OPEN mind DOT,safe

980,BEFORE sunrise has many remarkable things going ON almost too many TO fit INTO one review LIKE this but it s suffice TO say that it s one OF the most observant CHARACTER studies OF the nineties maybe even IN ALL OF contemporary cinema TO be observant NOT about love per say so much AS it s about A human CONNECTION DOT how does one fall IN love AT FIRST sight NO one does AT LEAST that s deep down the consensus that linklater wants TO SHOW WITH his film DOT AND yet there IS the possibility OF AS intense A CONNECTION OF A bond that can form IN those that ARE young AND WITH many ideas that can be expressed articulately AND WITH A BREADTH OF cynicism AND IS somehow very tender AND TRUE AT the same TIME DOT linklater here gives us the story OF celine AND jessie A french girl AND an american boy who GET OFF the same train heading TO vienna AND ON the way there START TO talking about things AT FIRST arbitrary THEN personal jessie seeing death FOR the FIRST TIME IN his great grandfather DOT jessie persuades celine TO GO along WITH him ON A night OUT ON the town IN vienna UNTIL his plane the NEXT morning DOT br br BEFORE sunrise gives jessie AND celine IN the midst OF the gorgeous vienna scenery AND locales TO GO ON AND ON about subjects that have A lot OF importance AND IN A sense IS about the act OF HAVING conversations OF what it s LIKE TO watch people HAVING one LEADING INTO another AND another DOT here it s often about relationships AND commitments AS jessie AND celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential OR seemingly so AND another that may tell A lot about their essential qualities DOT we hear confessions OF desires FOR other loves OR what weren T really loves OF being part OF A FAMILY OR part OF an upbringing that may OR may NOT inform how you ll love your life OF what it means TO believe OR NOT believe IN SOME religious form OR just TO have SOME CONNECTION TO ANY faith AND the soul i loved the BIT about the quakers IN the church AND sometimes laced WITH cynicism OR skepticism DOT jessie may be MORE responsible FOR that LAST part but what s fascinating about the film IS that it s never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays IN the concerns OF men AND women AT that age OF their lives DOT br br meanwhile it s ALWAYS great TO see ethan hawke AND julie delpy IN these roles WHERE they re NOT incessantly annoying IN that s generation x MODE but ARE the kinds OF people WHERE IF NOT IN the central conceit OF the film which isn T A bad one AT ALL but A necessary one one might think TO find walking along the streets OF A city somewhere DOT the conceit IS that OF an OLD romantic picture ala brief encounter ONLY here intimacy IS expressed IN the central CHARACTERS either BETWEEN EACH other WHERE sweet asides ARE actually acceptable i have TO tell you A secret jessie says AND THEN leans IN FOR A kiss ho ho OR IN the little moments that pop up WITH other people along the way DOT i loved the scene WITH the poet WHERE it s very cinematic A thing TO suddenly find A random romantic BIT player IN the midst OF A romantic picture WITH such beautiful words AT his disposal OR WITH the palm reader AND how the reactions FROM jessie AND celine ARE that we might SHARE but really ARE seeing them DO it FIRST hand DOT ALL the WHILE hawke AND delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses ARE being formed already FOR their adult lives AS it may LEAD OFF INTO the future DOT DOT DOT br br featuring splendid cinematography AND A script WITH an ear FOR NATURAL wit AND A TRUE sense OF what it means TO have A moment OF happiness however SELF contained AS it may LEAD INTO something MORE DOT who s TO say you can T suddenly be attached TO someone IF ONLY FOR less than hours AND be that much MORE attached than A married couple this IS perhaps linklater s thesis but there s MORE TO it than just that DOT it s A very dense film AND one that will have me calling back TO it repeatedly DOT one scene especially which IS BOTH cheesy AND brilliant IS WHEN the two OF them ARE talking ON the phone IN front OF EACH other mimicking their expositions might GO TO the other s friend DOT A,safe

985,i saw an early screening OF this film IN NEW york AND i along WITH my friends AND pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed DOT the movie wasn T even so bad it was good it was AS lifeless AS A snake bite victim DOT samual l DOT jackson looked surprisingly tired through most OF it AND the snake effects were lame DOT it reminded me OF one OF those cheesy scifi movies EXCEPT the cheesiness OF this movie was NOT funny OR even campy DOT it ALL seemed worn flat AND overtly formulaic DOT i M shocked TO say i actually think anaconda was MORE fun DOT it s easy TO understand that soap realizes it s A piece OF sit AND plays along WITH it but what the film fails TO embark ON IS A script that has ANY scares OF suspense DOT it s the worst kind OF lame movie it s joyless DOT,safe
986,sweet AND charming funny AND poignant plot less but meaningful BEFORE sunrise the third movie OF richard linklater IS dedicated TO everyone who ever been IN love IS IN love OR never been IN love but still dreams OF it AND hopes TO find it DOT it IS one OF the very rare movies that IS should will be equally interesting TO teenagers their parents AND even grandparents DOT it seems A very SIMPLE little movie WITH NO spectacular visual effects car chases OR LONG AND steamy sex scenes DOT two young people IN their early s two college students american tourist ethan hawke who IS RETURNING home AFTER the summer IN europe AND the french student julie delpy who goes TO paris TO attend the classes IN sorbonne meet ON A train DOT they ARE attracted TO EACH other instantly even BEFORE they START talking they hop OFF the train IN vienna WHERE they walk around exploring the city ALL night DOT they talk AND fall IN love DOT that s it that s the movie DOT it could ve been boring AND silly but INSTEAD it IS A lovely believable clever AND moving romance that ONLY gets better WITH EACH viewing AT LEAST FOR this viewer DOT high praise AND my sincere gratitude GO TO the director AND writers FOR delivering two charming CHARACTERS superb writing ALWAYS interesting AND witty dialogs two awesome performances AND the atmosphere OF magic that falling IN love IS DOT julie delpy who looks LIKE A botticelli s angel IS great IN portraying smart independent AND incredibly attractive young woman DOT,safe

988,FIRST let me say that BEFORE sunrise LIKE ALL movies IS NOT A movie FOR ALL tastes DOT it appears SOME folks ARE less smart TO acknowledge this fact but it IS remarkable TO contemplate the kind OF outright dislike this small harmless movie generates FROM SOME people DOT FOR me LIKE most folks here BEFORE sunrise struck A deep chord IN me i was truly stunned moved inspired BY it DOT this IS A movie that ultimately benefits FROM MORE than one viewing DOT it creates SOME OF the most awesomely unforgettable feelings AND emotions you can possibly imagine DOT it IS impossible TO imagine this world WITHOUT ever thinking about the kind OF inspirational feelings i got FROM it DOT br br the movie works AS A communion OF two fragile souls that ARE starting TO GET TO know EACH other DOT it IS very intelligent AND inspiring NOT so much IN how one conversation necessarily TIES INTO the NEXT OR the significance OF the topics OF jesse AND celine s discussions but rather the little nuances the perfectly articulate responses they provoke FROM EACH other DOT it captures an honest romantic yet fleeting human emotion that IS starting TO blossom IN the awesomely sublime viennese milieu it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the GREATEST compliment IN the world DOT AND what happens AFTER that night IS OPEN FOR debate but i never doubt that they won T EACH other again DOT br br the facile COMMENTS BY rockythebear AND the below USER ARE hopeless examples OF A doctrinaire dissenter unwilling TO accept AND RESPECT those who love this movie DOT br br see it AND it may change your way OF life DOT,safe

990,i watched this movie years ago DOT AND have watched it ON video an average OF once A YEAR since DOT it s the TYPE OF movie that s timeless because the themes ARE universal yet the stories AND conversation ARE so personal DOT it s ALSO one OF the very few movies that capture you FROM frame one til the credits roll despite the fact that there ARE really just two very involving CHARACTERS DOT this owes A lot TO the engaging acting BY hawke AND delpy who make us believe that they ARE actually jesse AND celine DOT this IS ALSO the FIRST movie i saw that mentioned reality tv AND now the phenomenon IS rampant i love the way this movie just envelops the audience IN its SPACE AND makes you think however jaded you may be that you ARE one OF those CHARACTERS DOT it ALSO made me want TO ride the train around europe i have NOT met anyone who has NOT been able TO relate TO this movie DOT maybe that speaks about myself my friends OR just the sheer genius OF this movie DOT,safe

1087,raising victor vargas A review br br you know raising victor vargas IS LIKE sticking your hands INTO A big steaming bowl OF oatmeal DOT it s warm AND gooey but you re NOT sure IF it feels RIGHT DOT try AS i might NO matter how warm AND gooey raising victor vargas became i was ALWAYS aware that something didn T quite feel RIGHT DOT victor vargas suffers FROM A certain overconfidence ON the director s part DOT apparently the director thought that the ethnic backdrop OF A latino FAMILY ON the LOWER east side AND an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof DOT he was RIGHT but it didn T fool me DOT raising victor vargas IS the story about A seventeen YEAR OLD boy CALLED you guessed it victor vargas victor rasuk who lives his teenage years chasing MORE skirt than the rolling stones could DO IN ALL the years they ve toured DOT the movie starts OFF IN ugly fat donna s bedroom WHERE victor IS sure TO seduce her but A cry FROM outside disrupts his PLANS WHEN his best friend harold kevin rivera comes A looking FOR him DOT caught IN the attempt BY harold AND his sister victor vargas runs OFF FOR damage CONTROL DOT yet even WITH the embarrassing implication that he s been boffing the homeliest girl IN the neighborhood NOTHING dissuades young victor FROM going OFF ON the hunt FOR MORE fresh meat DOT ON A hot NEW york city DAY they make way TO the LOCAL PUBLIC swimming pool WHERE victor s eyes catch A glimpse OF the lovely young nymph judy judy marte who s NOT just pretty but A strong AND independent too DOT the relationship that develops BETWEEN victor AND judy becomes the focus OF the film DOT the story ALSO focuses ON victor s FAMILY that IS comprised OF his grandmother OR abuelita altagracia guzman his brother nino ALSO played BY REAL life brother TO victor silvestre rasuk AND his sister vicky krystal rodriguez DOT the ACTION follows victor BETWEEN scenes WITH judy AND scenes WITH his FAMILY DOT victor tries TO cope WITH being an oversexed pimp daddy his feelings FOR judy AND his grandmother s conservative catholic upbringing DOT br br the problems that arise FROM raising victor vargas ARE A few but glaring errors DOT throughout the film you GET TO know certain CHARACTERS LIKE vicky nino grandma judy AND even judy s best friend melonie DOT the problem IS we know NOTHING OF victor vargas EXCEPT that he IS the biggest gigolo IN the neighborhood DOT we know that he knows how TO lick his lips AND comb his fro AND carry himself FOR the sake OF wooing girls INTO the sack but that s ALL DOT we know that nino plays piano AND quiet well you could see it BY the awards ON the FAMILY piano DOT we know his sister nicki IS A gossip loving girl WITH an invested interest IN watching tv DOT we know that grandma IS A hard working traditional latina woman who s trying TO raise her kids WITH conservatively IN A world OF excess corruption DOT yet WHERE IS the titular CHARACTER victor vargas he s IN this movie somewhere but we ONLY know what the movie tells us DOT this IS BY far the film s biggest flaw DOT victor vargas isn T so much A CHARACTER but A ping pong ball bouncing BETWEEN scenes WITH judy AND his grandmother but we never GET TO know who victor vargas really IS DOT this IS important because AS i ve mentioned the ONLY thing we know OF victor vargas IS that he s A sexually active teenager WITH A libido the SIZE OF manhattan DOT he s A total alpha male DOT victor vargas IS NOT the kind OF CHARACTER i sympathize WITH AT ALL DOT why should anyone so BY the END OF the movie IN the aftermath OF the climax ARE we truly led TO believe that somehow victor vargas has attained ANY DEPTH AND learned the errors OF his ways how could such A two dimensional CHARACTER have ANY DEPTH IF ONLY the director had worried A little MORE about fleshing OUT his main CHARACTER INSTEAD OF worrying about getting that perfect hand held shot DOT br br raising victor vargas brings TO life the world OF the latino INNER city neighborhood TO the big screen DOT something that few films have done BEFORE IN the past DOT the film has been complimented FOR feeling so REAL AND i won T br br argue WITH that DOT i haven T seen this LEVEL OF reality since cbs aired survivor DOT seriously although the movie has SOME nice shots OF the city the writer director peter sollett was way too dependent ON CLOSE ups AND hand held shots DOT this problem IS particularly noticed IN indoor scenes that ARE so claustrophobic i was forced TO perform deep breathing exercises TO keep FROM PASSING OUT DOT AS the film continues the shots GET tighter AND tighter WITH faces cropped FROM brow TO chin ON the screen you can practically smell victor vargas s cheap cologne DOT the overall effect IS unrealistic IN contrast DOT the indoor scenes OF INNER city apartments make them look small AND cramp which IS NOT TRUE DOT i ve been IN those TYPE apartments i used TO live IN one DOT they re NOT splendorous but they have high ceilings AND they re decent living spaces DOT BY the movie s standards you d think that these apartments were x cells OF brick AND mortar chipped paint AND cracked walls DOT unfortunately sollett s constant USE OF CLOSE ups AND one particularly bad shot WITH A zoom IN ON one scene come OFF AS totally amateurish DOT but raising victor vargas IS ONLY sollett s SECOND film AND his most well known A solid effort IN filmmaking that will hopefully GET better AS he continues TO make films DOT one review i READ summarized the movie AS ethnicity FOR ethnicity s sake AND i cannot agree MORE DOT IF victor vargas were truly A great film AND story THEN the CHARACTERS applicability wouldn T matter whether they were latino chinese etc DOT yet IF you were TO take this story AND stick it IN middle CLASS suburbia WITH A bunch OF teeny bopper white kids the results wouldn T be such glowing reviews AND we d see the film s flaws MORE clearly DOT indeed SOME other aspects OF the USE OF latinos IN this film bother me DOT WHILE SOME aspects OF victor vargas ARE accurate OTHERS i have TO question DOT FOR example victor nino AND vicky ALL SHARE the same room TO sleep DOT this SET OFF an alarm FOR me because it seemed contrary TO what i believe DOT ANY SELF respecting latino FAMILY wouldn T have two older brothers sharing the same room WITH A thirteen YEAR OLD girl DOT AT FIRST i was unsure perhaps i was wrong but AFTER speaking WITH my grandmother i knew my problem WITH this was justified DOT considering how conservative the grandmother IS you d think that vicky would have been sleeping IN her room DOT br br AS A latino who grew up IN A somewhat conservative cuban household raised BY my grandmother WHILE my mother was working FULL TIME i could relate TO the movie IN many ways which IS why my critical viewpoints ARE bittersweet because i really wanted TO love this movie DOT unfortunately my lack OF RESPECT FOR victor vargas sabotaged my feelings FOR the film DOT maybe it s because victor vargas reminds me OF those guys who were getting laid WHILE i was playing WITH my sega genesis WHEN i was seventeen DOT maybe it s because WITHOUT ANY further introspection BY the film victor vargas IS merely A stereotypical hot blooded latino who ll just END up shouting TO girls FROM his car hey bay bee ju want TO GET INTO my luv mah cheen either way i don T LIKE him so ultimately how can i LIKE A film about him so IF you ll excuse me i M going TO GO stick my hands INTO A bowl OF grits DOT br br,safe
1088,yet another example OF what british cinema can achieve A SIMPLE story told AND acted well DOT brenda blethyn gives A layered AND warming performance AS the recently widowed AND financially straitened grace ably assisted BY A solid supporting CAST DOT the quirky small town card gets played TO the hilt SIMILAR TO many tv series AND films that have come FROM the british isles IN recent years ballykissangel hamish macbeth AND OTHERS come TO mind DOT LIKE the forementioned this film makes USE OF SOME ravishingly beautiful rural scenery IN this CASE the wet AND wild cornish coast DOT br br SOME viewers might find wholesale acceptance OF cannabis USE A BIT challenging OTHERS might find the ending just A little too cute AND safe DOT but it s an enjoyable spliff TO be sure DOT,safe
1089,i notice that the previous reviewer who appears TO be still AT school gave this movie A very good review AND i can ONLY assume that this IS because the reviewer hasn T seen the far superior bbc adaptation OF this classic novel DOT the major problem i had WITH this VERSION was the casting OF anthony way AS tom LONG DOT anthony way was A talented boy treble who shot TO fame AFTER appearing IN the tv mini series the choir DOT i can ONLY assume that he was CAST FOR the ROLE OF tom LONG ON the strength OF his excellent acting IN the choir DOT unfortunately the small boy who appeared IN the choir had grown INTO A tall AND gangly youth BY the TIME tom s midnight garden was filmed AND AS such anthony fails TO convince AS schoolboy tom DOT it IS too far A stretch OF the imagination TO believe that tom AS played BY anthony would befriend the far younger hatty DOT IN the bbc VERSION tom AND hatty ARE much closer IN age AND the development OF their friendship IS so much MORE believable DOT FOR A movie even the special effects fail TO convince AND ARE NOT ANY noticeable improvement ON the tv effects DOT the casting AND acting OF this VERSION ARE inferior TO the earlier adaptation AND ALL IN ALL the movie was A lack lustre VERSION OF A TRUE classic DOT AS A FINAL observation i would point OUT that the vhs OF the bbc VERSION fetches well OVER DOT SECOND hand whereas A NEW dvd OF this VERSION can be bought FOR UNDER DOT need i say MORE,safe
1090,A delightful gentle comedic gem UNTIL the LAST five minutes which degenerate INTO run OF the mill british tv farce DOT the LAST five minutes COST it points IN my rating DOT despite this major plot AND STYLE flaw it s worth watching FOR the CHARACTER acting AND the UNIQUE cornwall setting DOT many fine little bits TO savor LIKE the tense eternity we ALL GO through waiting FOR the bank approval AFTER the clerk has swiped the credit card DOT DOT DOT made MORE piquant WHEN we re NOT quite sure the card IS NOT maxed DOT,safe
1091,IF you LIKE bad movies this IS the one TO see DOT it s incredibly low budget special effects you ll see what i mean AND USE OF non actors was what gave this film it s charm DOT IF you re bored WITH A GROUP OF friends i highly recommend renting this b movie gem DOT it s mulletrific,safe
1092,i saw saving grace RIGHT AFTER it came OUT ON video DOT since THEN it s become one OF my favorites the plot isn T particularly complex but it doesn T take away FROM the entertainment DOT it s chuck FULL OF comedic moments AND has A very endearing quality TO it DOT the CHARACTERS ARE what makes the movie so good DOT they EACH have their own quirky qualities which adds TO the humor the two OLD ladies played BY linda kerr scott AND phyllida law leaps TO mind DOT superb acting was done BY ALL particularly brenda blythen DOT she AND craig ferguson were great together IN pulling OFF SOME OF the funnier moments DOT IF you re looking FOR A good comedy i d definately recommend this movie,safe

OUT that there ARE A few elements that boarder ON pleasurable AND ARE A great improvement ON his previous film darkhunters which IS one OF the worst films i have ever seen DOT AT times the cinematography IS very good the music AND editing ARE A cut above his previous films AND SOME other low budget horror movies DOT i was impressed TO hear that it was achieved WITH A third OF the money spent ON the previous monstrosity DOT however the worst things about this movie ARE NOT TO be FOUND IN the body OF the film it IS ultimately A mildly diverting IF pointless movie that has been done TIME AND TIME again but amongst the dvd extras DOT br br IF you DO rent this film i implore you TO LISTEN TO the director s commentary it IS beyond belief DOT there IS MORE TO say about this than the film itself DOT one staggering part OF the commentary IS the director s claim that the film IS clich leaden because it was A preconceived idea DOT he says it IS A deliberate attempt TO USE ALL OF the clichs AND openly he wonders IF people will GET it DOT br br i M afraid TO say that IF this IS supposed TO be A clever nod AND A wink TO films OF the past AND the genre clichs WITHIN them THEN it IS NOT wittily scripted enough acted IN an appropriate tone nor directed WITH enough STYLE TO WORK DOT IF this film was made TO ORDER it leads me TO ask one question what was the point this IS s afilm that just slips RIGHT INTO the canon OF bad horror movies ANY attempt TO DO something clever OR different haven T worked DOT br br the NEXT nugget OF brilliance IS A conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats DOT they rightly point OUT that digital IS often synonymous WITH cheapness AND ease OF USE DOT however the best moment OF the conversation comes WHEN they bemoan the fact that WHEN michael mann makes A film IN the format he IS branded AS A visionary DOT there IS A SIMPLE distinction TO be made here mann IS A talented director who will USE the format TO fit his story AND STYLE roberts IS A horror hack who uses it TO produce bottom shelf genre pictures DOT i think the differences ARE obvious AND the comparison IS NOT ONLY arrogant but redundant DOT br br the best moment IS reserved FOR robert s COMMENTS about people who have taken the TIME TO review his previous film DOT those who didn T LIKE it ARE generalised AS geeks AND he even goes AS far AS TO single OUT SPECIFIC people FOR HAVING the nerve TO voice their opinion IN forums that encourage them TO DO just that DOT i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review OF his LAST film wasn T singled OUT FOR ridicule DOT the tirade goes further AS the GROUP joke about norwegian reviewers complete WITH hilarious accents TO imply that people FROM norway wouldn T know A good film simply because OF WHERE they ARE born DOT AS ALWAYS these sorts OF COMMENTS say MORE about those saying them than those they ARE targeting they simply make the director AND his friends look ignorant DOT br br the package IN rounded OUT WITH A tasteful featurette about how the sirens were CAST DOT robert s swears blind IN voice OVER i didn T want TO make A film that was LIKE baywatch AS we see audition tapes OF topless AND naked girls writhing around ON the ground DOT there IS ALSO A simpering SELF indulgent documentary about the making OF darkhunters during which robert s says that A reviewer has claimed

1168,romance IS IN the air AND love IS IN bloom IN victorian era england IN this light hearted story SET against A society IN A TIME IN which manners were still IN vogue the ladies were charming AND

entirely entertaining AND enjoyable DOT it s A pleasant affecting film WITH A wonderful CAST that successfully transports the viewer TO another TIME AND another place DOT it s light fare but absorbing

1318,passport TO pimlico IS A REAL TREAT FOR ALL fans OF british cinema DOT NOT ONLY IS it an enjoyable AND thoroughly entertaining comedy but it IS A cinematic flashback TO A bygone age WITH attitudes AND scenarios sadly now ONLY A memory IN british life DOT br br stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton who AFTER the accidental detonation OF an unexploded bomb discovers A wealth OF medieval treasure belonging TO the th century duke OF burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these LAST years DOT br br accompanying the treasure IS an ancient legal decree signed BY king edward iv OF england which has never been officially rescinded TO STATE that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil which means that IN the eyes OF international law pemberton AND the other LOCAL residents ARE NO longer british subjects but natives OF burgundy AND their tiny street an independent country IN it s own RIGHT AND A law unto itself DOT br br this SETS the war battered AND impoverished residents up IN good stead AS they believe themselves TO be outside OF english law AND jurisdiction so IN an act OF drunken defiance they burn their ration books destroy AND IGNORE their clothing coupons flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc declaring themselves fully independent FROM britain DOT br br however what THEN happens IS ever spiv black marketeer AND dishonest crook follows suit AND crosses the border INTO burgundy AS A refuge FROM the law AND post war restrictions TO sell their dodgy goods AND half OF london s consumers follow them IN ORDER TO dodge the ration making their quiet happy little haven A den OF thieves AND A rather crowded one AT that DOT br br appealing TO whitehall FOR assistance they ARE told that due TO developments this IS now A matter OF FOREIGN policy which his majesty s government IS reluctant TO become involved which leaves the residents high AND dry DOT they DO however DECLARE the area A legal frontier AND AS such SET up A fully equipped customs office AT the END OF the road mainly TO monitor smuggling than TO ensure ANY safety FOR the residents OF pimlico DOT br br eventually the border IS closed altogether starting A major siege WITH the bugundian residents slowly running OUT OF water AND food but never the less fighting ON IN TRUE british STYLE DOT AS one bugundian resident quotes we re english AND we ALWAYS were english AND it s just because we ARE english we ARE fighting so hard TO be bugundians br br A sentiment that IS soon echoed throughout the capital AS WHEN the rest OF london learn OF the poor bugundians plight they ALL feel compelled TO chip IN AND help them BY throwing food AND supplies OVER the barbed wire blockades DOT br br will whitehall who has fought OFF so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought TO it s knees BY this NEW batch OF foreigners especially AS these ones ARE english br br great tale AND great fun throughout DOT NOT TO be missed DOT,safe

1320,my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer today A writer AND journalist has put FORWARD the theory that just AS british film makers IN the eighties were often critical OF what they CALLED thatcher s britain the ealing comedies were intended AS satires ON attlee s britain the britain which had come INTO being AFTER the labour victory IN the GENERAL election DOT this theory was presumably NOT intended TO apply TO say kind hearts AND coronets which IS IF anything A satire ON the edwardian UPPER classes OR TO the ladykillers OR the lavender hill mob BOTH OF which may contain SOME satire but ARE NOT political IN nature DOT it can however be applied TO most OF the other films IN the series especially passport TO pimlico DOT br br pimlico IS OR AT LEAST was IN the forties A predominantly working CLASS district OF london SET ON the north bank OF the thames about A mile FROM victoria station DOT it IS NOT quite correct TO say AS has often been said that the film IS about pimlico declaring itself independent OF britain DOT what happens IS that an ancient charter comes TO light proving that IN the fifteenth century the area was ceded BY king edward iv TO the duchy OF burgundy DOT this means that technically pimlico IS an independent STATE AND has been FOR nearly five hundred years irrespective OF the wishes OF its inhabitants DOT the government promise TO pass A special act OF parliament TO rectify the anomaly but UNTIL the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom AND british laws DO NOT apply DOT br br because pimlico IS NOT subject TO british law the landlord OF the LOCAL pub IS FREE TO OPEN whatever hours he chooses AND LOCAL shopkeepers can sell whatever they please TO whomever they please unhindered BY the rationing laws DOT WHEN other traders START moving INTO the area TO sell their goods IN the streets the british authorities ARE horrified BY what they regard AS legalised black marketeering AND seal OFF the area TO try AND FORCE the burgundians AS the people OF pimlico have renamed themselves TO surrender DOT br br many OF the ealing comedies have AS their central theme the idea OF the little man taking ON the SYSTEM either AS an individual AS happens IN the man IN the white suit OR the lavender hill mob OR AS part OF A larger community AS happens IN whisky galore OR the titfield thunderbolt DOT the central theme OF passport IS that OF ordinary men AND women taking ON bureaucracy AND government imposed regulations which seemed TO be an increasingly important feature OF life IN the britain OF the forties DOT the film s particular target IS the rationing SYSTEM DOT during the war the SYSTEM had been accepted BY most people AS A necessary sacrifice IN the fight against nazism but it became increasingly politically controversial WHEN the government tried TO retain it IN peacetime DOT it was A major factor IN the growing unpopularity OF the attlee administration which had been elected WITH A LARGE majority IN AND organisations such AS the british housewives league were SET up TO campaign FOR the abolition OF rationing DOT i cannot agree WITH the reviewer who stated that the main targets OF the film s satire were the spivs black marketeers who play A relatively minor part IN the ACTION OR the housewives league who DO NOT appear AT ALL DOT the satire IS very much targeted AT the bureaucrats who ARE portrayed either AS HAVING A rules FOR rules sake mentality OR A desire TO pass the buck AND avoid HAVING TO take ANY ACTION AT ALL DOT br br i suspect that IF the film were TO be made today it would have A different ending WITH pimlico remaining independent AS A british VERSION OF monaco OR san marino DOT indeed i suspect that today this concept would probably serve AS the basis OF A tv sitcom rather than A film DOT IN however four years AFTER the END OF the war the film makers were keen stress patriotism AND british IDENTITY so the film ends WITH pimlico being reabsorbed INTO britain DOT one OF the best known lines FROM the film IS we ALWAYS were english AND we ALWAYS will be english AND it s just because we ARE english that we re sticking up FOR our RIGHT TO be burgundians DOT there IS A sharp contrast BETWEEN the rather heartless attitude OF officialdom WITH the common sense tolerance AND good humour OF the cockneys OF pimlico ALL OF which ARE presented AS being quintessentially british CHARACTERISTICS DOT br br most OF the ACTION takes place during A summer drought AND sweltering heatwave but IN the LAST scene AFTER pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops AND it starts TO pour WITH rain DOT GLOBAL warming may have altered things slightly but FOR many years part OF being british was the ability TO HOLD the belief whatever STATISTICS might say TO the contrary that britain had an abnormally wet climate DOT the ability TO make jokes about that climate was equally important DOT br br there IS A good performance FROM stanley holloway AS arthur pemberton the grocer AND small TIME LOCAL politician who becomes the prime minister OF FREE pimlico AND an amusing cameo FROM margaret rutherford AS A batty history professor DOT IN the main however this IS appropriately enough FOR A film about A small community pulling together an example OF ensemble acting WITH NO REAL star performances but WITH everyone making A contribution TO an excellent film DOT it lacks the ill will AND rancour OF many MORE recent satirical films but its wit AND satire ARE NO less effective FOR ALL that DOT it remains one OF the funniest satires ON bureaucracy ever made AND WITH the possible EXCEPTION OF kind hearts AND coronets IS my personal favourite among the ealing comedies DOT,safe

1322,EVERY TIME this film IS ON the bbc somebody IN the radio times says how it IS A satire against the post war world OF rationing AND the welfare STATE DOT i DO NOT think this IS the point OF the film AT ALL DOT the film parodies the spivs small TIME criminals who ran the blackmarket AND the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really A tory front organisation DOT br br YES OF course the film sends up the political social situation but IN the END the people realise that they need ALL the controls TO ensure A fair society they want TO be british AND muddle through rather than FOREIGN DOT br br but i don T think they GO back TO being exactly LIKE they were BEFORE DOT,safe

1482,AS many reviewers here have noted the film VERSION differs quite A BIT FROM the stage VERSION OF the story DOT i have never seen the stage VERSION OF the story AND therefore i have A MORE favorable review OF the film than many other reviewers DOT perhaps richard attenborough was NOT the best choice FOR director OF the film but the film IS still an entertaining account OF several dancers trying TO make the big TIME IN choreographer michael douglas SHOW DOT the film does RIGHT BY NOT selecting ANY famous actors OR performers TO wind up IN the FINAL try OUT GROUP DOT this way our attention IS focused ON the dancers movements AND individual stories AND struggles AS they unfold during A marathon DAY OF try outs DOT douglas IS ALSO probably NOT the best choice FOR the part DOT apparently SOME songs were cut OUT IN favor OF A NEW one AND the backstage clich ridden story OF A romantic liaison BETWEEN A dancer AND the choreographer was added DOT i have TO say IN ALL fairness this was the weakest part OF the film DOT the repeated intrusions cassie made during try outs appear TO mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has TO make WHEN engaging IN the artistic professions IN the absence OF talent AND OR luck DOT however this aspect OF the film has been done TO death IN the past AND it s curious TO see this tired OLD shoe kicking its heel up once again DOT the revelations OF the dancers themselves began promisingly enough WITH the i can DO that NUMBER but THEN it plodded A little AT various points WHILE the dancers were telling their stories DOT frankly their stories differed little FROM REAL life folks who never GET A chance LIKE this DOT OF stars DOT,safe
