98,titanic directed BY james cameron presents A fictional love story ON the historical setting OF the titanic DOT the plot IS SIMPLE noncomplicated OR NOT FOR those who love plots that twist AND turn AND keep you IN suspense DOT the END OF the movie can be figured OUT WITHIN minutes OF the START OF the film but the love story IS an interesting one however DOT kate winslett IS wonderful AS rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed BY cal billy zane DOT early ON the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio A LOWER CLASS artist ON his way TO america AFTER winning his ticket aboard titanic IN A poker game DOT IF he wants something he goes AND gets it unlike the UPPER CLASS who ARE so concerned WITH their social worries DOT the two fall IN love AND the audience sees the sinking OF the titanic primarily through their eyes DOT br br the movie begins IN modern times WITH the exploration OF the wreck BY A GROUP searching FOR treasures that sunk WITH the titanic which has recently occurred DOT one OF the survivors OF the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard OF the exploration OF the wreck ON television AND IS flown TO the boat WHERE the SEARCH IS being led FROM TO tell OF what she remembers TO help the SEARCH DOT she gets TO telling her memory OF the one AND ONLY voyage OF the titanic DOT WITH this the scene shifts TO southhampton ireland WHERE the titanic SET sail FROM ON april AS ALL the passengers ARE boarding DOT AFTER another stop ON the irish coast titanic went OUT TO see ON its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound FOR NEW york DOT historically the FIRST few days OF the voyage went BY uneventful but the fictional plot OF the story IS developed during this TIME AS rose sees the hopeless entrapement OF an engagement that she IS IN TO the wealthy cal hockley AND falls IN love WITH third CLASS passenger jack dawson DOT captain smith alledgedly AS shown IN the movie was urged BY the white star line director TO increase the speed OF the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines AND receive extra publicity BY arriving IN NEW york ON thursday night AND NOT ON friday morning AS planned DOT smith THEN ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years OF experience TO stretch the titanic s legs OUT TO FULL speed DOT the titanic had reports that the waters IN the atlantic they were sailing IN were FULL OF icebergs but they ignored these warnings AND proceeded AT FULL speed AS shown IN the movie DOT ON april AT an iceberg was sighted DOT they attempted TO shut OFF the engines AND turn the ship OUT OF the PATH OF the iceberg but there was NOT enough TIME AND the ship hit the iceberg ON the starboard side AS depicted IN the film DOT the portrayal OF the many small holes IN the side OF the ship AND NOT one LARGE gash along the side IS accurate DOT the crew OF titanic sent OUT distress calls AND SET OFF distress rockets AS shown UNTIL WHEN the lights finally failed DOT the lights OF the california were spotted six miles away but they failed TO realize what was going ON AND did NOT respond TO titanic s many pleas FOR help DOT the california had tried earlier IN the DAY TO warn titanic OF the severe ice that had caused them TO stop their trip but titanic had brushed them OFF causing the california TO turn OFF its radio AND LEAVE the titanic ON its own DOT the FIRST CLASS women AND children were the FIRST AS depicted TO be put INTO the twenty lifeboats that were ON the ship DOT overwhelmingly the third CLASS passengers suffered the most amount OF deaths OF ANY CLASS AND the crew was hit hard IN this tragedy too DOT the word OF white star line employees AND FIRST CLASS passengers was believed OVER that OF SECOND AND third CLASS passengers WHEN authorities were trying TO gain information OF the sinking DOT ALSO the metal that was used TO build the titanic has been FOUND IN recent years UNDER conditions OF severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank TO be extremely brittle DOT overall the basic plot IS very accurate IN its portayal OF the events AND the times AT which these events took place ON the titanic DOT br br many OF the CHARACTERS IN the story were NOT REAL AND created simply FOR the purpose OF the movie OR AS composite CHARACTERS TO represent possible CHARACTERISTICS AND ideas OF people ON the ship DOT the core GROUP OF rose jack cal AND rose s mother ALL were fictional CHARACTERS added INTO the story AS they represent different GROUPS OF people FROM the TIME DOT yet many CHARACTERS such AS the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay AND ALL OF the titanic s officers were REAL DOT the maiden voyage was going TO be captain edward smith s LAST voyage anyway AS he planned TO retire afterwards DOT he had been A part OF the white star line since WHERE he worked his way up TO his status AS the millionaire s captain WHEN the titanic sunk DOT the portrayals OF the officers IS accurate AS ONLY four survived the tragedy EXCEPT FOR the officer who threatened TO kill ALL OF the passengers OF the ship WITH his pistol DOT he IS ON record AS acting heroicly AND was misportrayed TO the point that james cameron apologized AND evoked A monument IN his honor IN the officer s former canadian hometown DOT AS shown IN the movie there was A LANGUAGE problem BETWEEN the crew AND many OF the LOWER CLASS passengers FROM non english speaking nations DOT IN addition officer lowe was the ONLY officer who came back IN the lifeboat AS depicted DOT the OLD people shown IN their bed AS the water came IN their room were based ON the strauss DOT NOT wanting TO LEAVE her husband s side mrs DOT strauss refused TO GET IN her lifeboat AND died WITH her husband ON the titanic DOT furthermore mr DOT goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy AND smoking A cigar reportedly did GO OUT LIKE this dressed IN his best DOT the richest man ON the ship john jacob astor who OWNED most OF manhattan died nonetheless AS well but his much younger wife was saved IN A lifeboat DOT IN addition molly brown was saved AND later had medals made up FOR the crew OF the carpethia that picked the survivors OF titanic up FROM the water DOT her ticket ON the titanic had COST OVER four thousand dollars AND BY the END OF her life she ended up broke DOT ALL OF the interiors OF the ship were masterfully replacated down TO the LAST pieces OF china AND silverware DOT the gymnasium which IS hardly seen IS recreated perfectly WITH ALL OF the machines reproduced TO MATCH those seen IN OLD photographs DOT the wonderful outfits AND costuming were an excellent re creation OF the post victorian era OF DOT the rich AT this TIME practically ruled everything AS the women s suffrage movement had NOT quite gotten moving yet DOT women during this TIME often married FOR financial SECURITY AS rose was considering doing AND normally took A back seast status TO their husbands AS cal wished FOR rose TO DO DOT the rich did NOT take well TO NEW money such AS molly brown AS depicted DOT everything OF the TIME was very formal DOT women had TO be escorted TO dinner BY A male figure AS seen WITH IN the dining scenes DOT smoking was NOT very common among women OF the TIME but holders OF cigarettes which were just coming IN AT the TIME were used AS seen WITH rose IN the movie DOT men OF the TIME generally smoked cigars NOT cigarettes DOT women were constained physically BY their corsets AND socially BY society DOT although james cameron had NO background IN historical films he brought IN experts OF titanic coupled WITH two years spent CROSS REFERENCING the history OF the titanic AND few liberties were taken DOT the beautiful cinematography AND special effects ALSO helped TO make the film even MORE breathtaking DOT br br A recognizable message can be seen IN the movie titanic AS the people ON the ship had about three hours TO contemplate their demise DOT the director james cameron shows the various reactions TO this TIME OF crisis IN people s lives DOT everyone reacts differently AND he gets you TO think OF how you might have reacted had you been IN that situation ON the titanic ON that fateful night DOT IN addition this film IS A reflection OF the s WHEN it was produced AS it gives A look INTO the wreck OF the titanic DOT ONLY IN the past fifteen years has the site OF the actual titanic been FOUND AND explored DOT this movie was able TO give us A deeper look INTO A disaster that many would NOT have viewed DOT however the moral question OF whether people today should be taking treasures FROM the wreck OF an underwater graveyard IS posed DOT there have been attempts TO stop treasure seeking missions such AS the one portrayed IN titanic but ALL have failed DOT AS it stands today anyone can make A voyage TO the titanic AND take whatever valuables they AS portrayed IN the film showing the GENERAL VALUES OF our TIME ON this matter DOT br br technically the film IS very well done DOT TO GET footage OF the wreck AT the bottom OF the ocean it took twelve dives TO GET ALL OF the footage needed FOR the movie DOT IN addition A special camera had TO be created TO withstand the intense pressure AT the bottom OF the ocean DOT cameron did NOT plan ON USING the probe TO GO AS far inside titanic AS anyone has IN the years since the ship sunk but it worked OUT that this provided an UNIQUE perspective INTO the ship DOT furthermore throughout the film fade ins AND outs FROM the wreck OF titanic TO the scene OF titanic during its actual voyage DOT this shift BETWEEN the modern scene TO the past scene during the voyage works AS an excellent transition that makes the story easy TO follow IN aclear manner DOT AT the very beginning OF the movie A septune recreation IS used TO recreate the scene WHEN the actual people LEFT the european coast ON titanic giving it distinction FROM the rest OF the events OF the film DOT br br titanic plays almost LIKE A historical biography AND IS LIKE A WORK OF art A TRUE epic DOT LIKE most history novels we know the ending but it doesn T take away FROM the wonderful treats that can be FOUND IN this picture DOT certain aspects OF this film ARE academy award material INCLUDING costuming sound cintematography AND editing DOT IF you LIKE interesting CHARACTERS that will give you an insight INTO the life OF CHARACTERS IN the early s AND how they face disaster THEN this movie definitely IS FOR you DOT br br,Safe
99,this IS the biggest flop OF DOT i don know what director has IS his mind OF creating such A big disaster DOT the songs have been added WITHOUT situations the story have been stretched TO fill the hrs gap AND most disgusting ARE the ACTION stunts performed BY the actors it s LIKE everyone ARE HAVING superpowers they can run IN BETWEEN the bullets ARE fire AND NOTHING happens TO them AND one person fighting WITH people DOT ONLY the best performance was BY anil kapoor man he IS ALL TIME AT his best playing the ROLE OF villain WITH A comic act speaking hinglish DOT DOT DOT akki IS ALSO done A good job DOT DOT DOT DOT but the movieee just forget it DOT,Safe

director that was unable TO complete his vision would have the opportunity TO have his vision restored DOT it seems LIKE A winning situation DOT AND THEN you START watching this assembly OF footage

has imagined OVER the years it really should have been A thrill TO finally see this project DOT AND it IS ONLY A very few times DOT br br you know things ARE shaky WHEN the very FIRST BIT OF TEXT ON

pretty neat things ARE alright FOR these few fleeting moments UNTIL we see footage FROM stm intermixed WITH NEW effects FOR this project AND it doesn T convince AT ALL DOT AND FROM this point ON it never ever lets up DOT it s probably NOT RIGHT TO judge A movie because OF bad visual effects but WHEN this IS supposedly the direct follow up TO A movie whose tag line was you ll believe A man can fly it s difficult TO believe anything shown ON screen here DOT the best effects IN this ARE FROM the original productions DOT br br another issue WITH this re cut DOT A lot OF it just doesn T make sense DOT the ONLY reason ANY OF it really works IS because we ve ALL seen the theatrical VERSION OF superman ii A movie that does make sense DOT lester s superman ii fills IN the holes OF this assembly DOT part OF this could be because donner didn T GET TO complete shooting the other part could be because the makers OF this project were intent ON USING AS little lester material AS possible DOT what we END up WITH IS an assembly OF footage that makes superman iv look airtight AND coherent DOT br br AFTER viewing this one gets the sense that WHILE lester was faithful AND comfortable USING donner material michael thau AND his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed BY lester DOT the best scenes IN the donner cut ARE the ones lifted relatively intact FROM the released VERSION OF superman ii DOT that includes the moon SEQUENCE AND the diner SEQUENCE NOT ironically BOTH were filmed BY donner DOT but anything ELSE FROM that movie filmed BY lester IS re edited IN such A hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem LIKE A ham fisted know NOTHING DOT WHILE lester honored the donner material lester here IS thrown UNDER the bus DOT br br so IS there anything good IN this RELEASE well marlon brando IS IN it AND that s neat TO see DOT IN fact watching ANY OF the material shot BY donner IS neat since it was ALL filmed AT the same TIME AS superman the movie DOT but that ONLY highlights the problems OF this RELEASE DOT ANY OF the major scenes really just lois jumping AND scenes WITH marlon brando would have been better served AS completed scenes IN A deleted scenes SECTION DOT INSTEAD they ARE shoe horned INTO A nonsensical narrative WITH inferior performances many alternate takes FROM familiar scenes ARE used sloppy edits AND bad decisions DOT br br

that followed BY jackie cooper walking INTO A dark bathroom turning the lights ON i was INITIALLY confused BY this because i expected TO see lois DOT the entire assembly IS filled WITH questionable choices LIKE this DOT br br battle scenes ARE A mess too WITH NO geography BETWEEN cuts DOT it s just random ACTION DOT OF course the major ACTION scenes were shot BY lester AND his material IS ONLY used AS A bridge TO the NEXT SET OF donner outtakes OR alternates DOT they should have used MORE OF lester s footage but probably had too much pride TO admit that DOT br br the sloppiness extends TO the military missile AS well DOT AS noted elsewhere the missile shown IN the donner cut bears the designation xk WHILE we ALL know it s the xk A blind man IN stm knows that the producers OF this assembly who tried so hard TO honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes IN AND that mistake IS indicative OF the quality OF the entire production DOT FOR ALL the supposed care that was put INTO this the FINAL product has an air OF shoddiness TO it that IS inescapable DOT br br the entire affair would probably be easier TO digest IF warner s didn T make this A separate RELEASE here IN the states DOT AS it IS we re expected TO pay FOR what IS essentially A bonus disc OF deleted scenes WITH A play ALL OPTION DOT it s really ONLY worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but AFTER that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet FOR dust AND little ELSE DOT i know AFTER my experience OF watching this i had NEW RESPECT FOR lester s VERSION DOT it s BY NO means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were IN the script that stand OUT here IN bold relief DOT he managed TO make A movie that has

series AND movies DOT AS far AS the series goes they DO A pretty good job IN bringing the fun AND magic OF the japanese versions TO television DOT so what IS their problem WHEN it comes TO the movies honestly now i have seen ALL three pokmon movies IN japanese AND i will definitely be seeing the fourth one DOT they ARE excellent movies DOT they ARE ALL enjoyable AND fun TO watch DOT AND AFTER seeing pokmon IN theaters i can T help but wonder how these american producers READ the japanese scripts DOT the way it appears it seems that they READ AND see something that says INSERT EMPTY moral here IN big bold faced letters DOT it definitely appears that way AS they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used ON msb extreme sarcasm there AND created this crap DOT br br possible spoilers FROM here ON br br well i guess i should FIRST talk about pikachu s rescue adventure DOT my FIRST gripe WITH this came WITH NO narration DOT i guess they got enough bad COMMENTS ON the pokdex narration that plagued pikachu s vacation AND INSTEAD OF going WITH A caring gentle woman s voice AS appeared IN pikachu NO natsu yasumi AND pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration ALL together DOT this wouldn T have been A problem EXCEPT FOR one thing DOT did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn T let togepi GO UNTIL the END possibly the fans but i M sure NOT the parents DOT THEN there s the theme song DOT i couldn T help but roll my eyes AT this one DOT the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou AND was sung BY japanese children DOT it was fun AND enjoyable DOT this one nauseating DOT now one OF my favorite parts OF the short was the dancing kireihana DOT nice music fun TO watch DOT that s changed WITH the bellossom DOT the music sucked FOR one but ON top OF that they had ALL the pokmon talk during the music which turned OUT TO be jumpy annoying AND just unnecessary DOT oh AND THEN there s the poliwhirl who thinks he s A poliwrath DOT you d think that guys that WORK WITH these CHARACTERS constantly would AT LEAST learn what they ARE DOT basically NOT much could save this little ill fated dub which IS very unfortunate considering its potential DOT but i haven T touched ON the worst OF it yet DOT br br you d think that the warning signs would ve been apparent TO me WHEN i received my issue OF nintendo POWER DOT FOR SOME unfathomable reason i had been PLACING SOME faith IN kids AND the wb DOT my thoughts were well they screwed up ON the FIRST movie but the SECOND IS different AS far AS the theme goes so they should DO well DOT that IN mind i just didn T pay attention TO the warning signs i encountered IN the theaters WHEN the trailers said you will believe that one person can make ALL the difference DOT WITH the way they said that AT EVERY turn i was hoping that this would NOT turn INTO A moral fest LIKE msb did AT the END OF the english VERSION DOT THEN comes nintendo POWER IN which i see ALL my fears realized IN the words the main feature the POWER OF one DOT AT that point i became A BIT MORE uneasy DOT the POWER OF one NOT A good sign DOT however i still kept SOME OF my FALSE faith DOT big mistake DOT br br sitting IN the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved IN japanese being turned INTO complete AND utter junk DOT i hear COMMENTS that say it was better because the moral was MORE subtle DOT i can see A point IN that since they didn T pander this thing repeating it OVER AND OVER LIKE IN msb DOT however it did MORE damage than anything ELSE IN this movie DOT FIRST OF ALL the legend that was READ throughout was changed A BIT TO READ the world turns TO ash DOT ah hah DOT so ash IS the chosen one whatever DOT IN the japanese VERSION the inhabitants OF arshia needed A pokmon trainer TO carry OUT their traditional ceremony DOT this TIME he s the chosen one DOT A greater way that this did damage was TO lugia DOT lugia was one OF the coolest CHARACTERS IN A pokmon movie DOT DOT DOT DOT WHEN the movie was about lugia DOT IN this one lugia IS forced TO take A back seat TO ash DOT IN the scene WHERE they re flying back TO the main island lugia AND ash ARE discussing the conditions OF lugia s existence NOT that ash IS going TO make ALL the difference DOT overall IN this category ash wasn T really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped BY many along the way DOT br br A lot OF the other stuff IS kind OF nit picking DOT furura s flute song wasn T nearly AS sweet AND enjoyable AS the japanese one DOT jirarudan s speech TO them saying his collection started WITH A mew card ugh DOT even worse misty s outrage originally concerned the way moltres AND zapdos were being held DOT why didn T you put them IN pokballs WHEN you caught them this IS LIKE caging them TO be displayed DOT much different FROM whining about him thinking pokmon ARE things TO be collected LIKE stamps DOT IF there were ANY REAL redeeming VALUES IN this they came FROM team rocket DOT SOME pretty funny lines DOT NOT really TO make me laugh OUT loud but MORE TO make me giggle AND slightly ease the pains IN my stomach DOT well that was officially

their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements A band OF hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played BY donald pleasance here giving one OF his most ridiculous performances AND that s saying something AND IN the tradition OF many previous western SET romantic comedies EACH other DOT br br during the course OF their misadventures the two opposites ARE inevitably AND predictably attracted TO EACH other AND eventually END up getting it ON WHILE gant has A freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg NO less IN what was surely the ONLY conveniently located cave FOR AT LEAST A twelve mile radius that wasn T filled WITH rattlesnakes mountain lions OR who knows what TO say NOTHING OF the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy WITH such A primo apartment there i GO thinking IN nyc REAL estate terms again DOT br br realizing that their love could never flourish outside OF the cave cresta leaves gant AND makes it TO the fort BY herself ONLY TO discover that the moron IN charge won T spare A couple OF men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs ALL available personnel TO launch an attack ON the nearby cheyenne village AND once cresta gets wind OF that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby TO be AND makes A beeline straight TO the cheyenne TO warn them OF what s coming DOT br br what happens NEXT IS what gained the film its infamy it turns OUT that ALL the wacky misadventures AND squabbling were ALL just A LEAD IN TO A hideous reenactment OF the sand creek massacre an orgy OF rape torture AND GENERAL sadistic evil perpetrated IN the NAME OF keeping the country clean AND almost forty years AFTER its RELEASE this SEQUENCE still disturbs AND nauseates FOR its sheer cruelty DOT children ARE trampled beneath the hooves OF charging horses OR impaled ON bayonets unarmed people ARE beheaded A nice effect i have TO admit women ARE stripped AND pawed BY gangs OF slavering brutes THEN raped AND mutilated IN one truly sickening INSTANCE A naked native woman puts up too much OF A fight so her rapist INSTEAD decides TO cut OFF her breasts which we thankfully ONLY see the START OF BEFORE the camera moves ON TO chronicle SOME other hideous act AND scores OF innocent people ARE shot AND dismembered their compone nt parts impaled ON pikes AND waved about IN victorious celebration OR kept AS the most ghoulish

exploitative manner IN which the atrocities ARE depicted DOT br br i M ALL IN favor OF westerns that don T shy away FROM honest portrayals OF how the west was won OR stolen IF truth be told but this film has NO idea OF what kind OF movie it wants TO be one MINUTE it s A heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment OF the natives was totally effed up well duh THEN it s A light hearted battle OF the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant IS AND manages TO look hot IN her tasty red calico poncho WITH NO undies but that ALL goes OUT the WINDOW WHEN donald pleasance shows up WITH an unintentionally hilarious pair OF buck toothed dentures AND our heroes must figure OUT how TO ESCAPE FROM his murderous clutches IN A sub plot that goes nowhere ALL OF which culminates IN the aforementioned apocalyptic climax DOT ANY one OF those tacks would have been okay FOR A coherent film but the END RESULT IS A slapdash mess that milked the horrors OF its FINAL ten minutes FOR ALL they were worth IN the film s promotion AND poster imagery DOT br br but BY trying TO be ALL things TO ALL audiences soldier blue ends up AS an incoherent preachy mulligan stew OF presumably well intentioned political correctness but IF they were going TO tell the story OF the sand creek massacre wouldn T it have been A good idea TO have SOME indian CHARACTERS who were MORE than just walk ons WITH murphy brown acting AS their mouthpiece we GET TO know absolutely NOTHING OF the people who GET wiped OUT solely FOR what appears TO be A crass ploy TO lure gorehound

659,WHEN A movie OF A book seems pointless AND incomprehensible the cause can invariably be FOUND IN the book either it was pointless TO START WITH OR the point IS one NOT easily conveyed TO film OR the movie missed the point which IS the most frequent OF these results AND the easiest TO happen especially WHEN the point IS one NOT easily DEFINED DOT the book morvern callar has A point EVERY reader OF the book must have felt this AND felt AS IF he had gotten it but i suspect most OF them could NOT STATE it IN words DOT i M NOT sure i can myself but perhaps it comes TO this OR something LIKE it things come things GO such IS life but we carry ON OR AT ANY rate SOME OF us people LIKE morvern DO DOT NO doubt A MORE erudite critic could construct A MORE adequate definition DOT but the important fact IS that there IS A point possibly the SUM OF the entire story IS the point AND that this would have been the main thing TO keep IN VIEW AND TO carry OVER IN adapting the story TO film DOT the maker OF this film evidently missed the point AND doesn T substitute one OF her own AND so the film IS about NOTHING DOT br br this IS NOT the usual complaint OF A book lover that his favorite TEXT has been violated DOT the merit OF the book IS something i conceded grudgingly IN reading it i FOUND it A bloody nuisance AND an occasion FOR kicking the author IN the pants AND getting him IN TO finish the job properly DOT the narrative IS supposed TO be the WORK OF the half educated morvern but that illusion IS constantly dispelled BY A dozen different TYPES OF literary effect AS IF the author were poking AT her WITH his pen there ARE inconsistencies OF STYLE AND tone AS IF different sections had been composed AT different times AND ANY conclusions i could reach about morvern had TO remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended AND which he did NOT FOR INSTANCE despite morvern s own SELF characterization AS A raver am i wrong that IN the END she remains essentially A working CLASS scots girl AND beneath her wrapping OF music downloads NOT so different FROM those OF generations past IN ANY CASE despite my irritation AT the author i couldn T deny that his book stuck WITH me AND what i couldn T GET OUT OF my head was his CHARACTER s attitude her angle ON the world which was almost AS vivid AS A goya portrait DOT morvern IS the kind OF person who s ALWAYS encountering situations AT once rather comic AND rather horrible occasionally she invites them but MORE often they land ON her LIKE flies so that much OF her life consists OF A kind OF gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical AND unconsciously philosophical AND that doesn T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE it idiosyncratically enough DOT the complex OF incidents AND OF morvern s responses TO them ARE the substance OF the book AND its achievement IN exposing A CROSS SECTION OF existence it would be difficult TO illuminate otherwise FOR ALL my dislike OF the book i can see this DOT br br the morvern just described IS NOT the morvern OF the movie OR IF it IS most OF her IS kept offscreen DOT an actress who might have been A good fit FOR the CHARACTER had she been the RIGHT age AT the RIGHT TIME IS angharad rees FROM the OLD tv series poldark DOT samantha morton THEN would seem LIKE good casting she s rather the same sort OF actress AND IN one OF her earlier movies jesus son she played A girl who WITH A few adjustments could have been turned INTO this one DOT unfortunately AS the film turned OUT she doesn T have the CHARACTER FROM the book TO play DOT FOR one thing the book IS one that IF it IS TO be dramatized virtually cries OUT FOR monologues BY the main CHARACTER TO the audience WITHOUT her COMMENTS her perspective her voice the story loses most OF its meaning DOT it has lost MORE OF it IN that the adaptor has expurgated it OF its comic AND horrible elements the most memorable incidents FROM the book ARE curtailed BEFORE they turn grotty AND so morvern s responses whether OF amusement OR distaste depending ON her mood ARE missing too AND the incidents NO longer have A reason FOR being IN the story DOT IN short the filmmaker chose FOR SOME reason TO turn A brisk edgy serio comic novel INTO A genteel art tv film AND chose AS her typical image one OF ms DOT morton languishing IN A artistically shaded melancholy AS IF the outing morvern signs up FOR were A tour OF the stations OF the CROSS DOT this isn T AT ALL what the book OR the morvern OF the book was about DOT FOR another thing the morvern OF the movie isn T scottish the actress said IN an interview she hadn T had TIME TO study up the accent AND she ought TO be it s important that she her FAMILY AND her mates ARE ALL FROM A single place DOT AND finally the film IS missing the END OF the story morvern s spending ALL she has AND coming home TO icy darkness it s winter the dam has frozen the POWER has gone OUT AND the pub IS dark DOT minus this AND minus ALL OF the rest what s LEFT IS A failed art film A dead film about A subject whose strength lay precisely IN her refusal OR native inability ever TO give IN TO being dead DOT,Safe

687,cia codenamealexa IS an ABSOLUTE horrible rip OFF OF luc besson s classic film la femme nikita DOT the film IS basically about A woman who IS taken IN AND trained BY the cia AND IS forced TO DO A secret mission FOR them DOT pretty much the same story STRUCTURE OF la femme nikita the acting combo OF lorenzo lamas AND o DOT j DOT simpson IS perhaps the worst IN cinema history DOT lamas acting IS simply A bad steven segal impersonation DOT watching orenthal act IN this film IS an excruciating experience DOT br br the writing AND acting IS so poor IN this film AT times it IS laughable DOT there ARE so many ACTION movie conventions IN the film it IS ridiculous unnecessary car explosions people flying thru glass windows terrorists bad ponytails etc DOT the musical score resembles david michael frank s score FOR hard TO kill which furthers the steven segal theme OF this movie DOT there IS plenty OF martial arts IN the film AND it IS pretty well done FOR A low budget american production DOT the mindless ACTION AND OVER the top acting never lets up AND i have TO admit i was mildly entertained DOT br br lorenzo lamas had the look OF an ACTION star back IN the early s but he IS certainly NO ACTION star that IS why he IS doing soap operas AND NOT ACTION blockbusters DOT my recommendation IS that you skip cia codenamealexa AND CHECK OUT la femme nikita INSTEAD DOT,Safe
688,i nominate this AND babylon AS the best television sci fi series made DOT BOTH stand OUT IN my mind because unlike early star trek series there IS A consistent evolution OF plots AND CHARACTERS DOT IF you look AT the original star trek AND star trektng they were fine shows but there was NO overall theme OR plot that connected ALL the episodes DOT IN many ways you could usually watch the shows totally OUT OF SEQUENCE WITH NO difficulty understanding what IS occurring DOT this was less the CASE WITH deep SPACE WITH its giant battles that took up ALL OF the FINAL season AND the other trek shows AS there was MORE OF A larger story that unified them DOT this coherence seems TO have developed AS A concept WITH babylon AND saw this TO an even greater extent WITH sg DOT the bottom line IS that IN many ways this series was LIKE watching A FAMILY OR A LONG novel slowly take form DOT sure there were A few throwaway episodes that were NOT connected TO the rest but these were very few AND far BETWEEN AND were ALSO usually pretty funny DOT br br AND speaking OF funny i loved that sg kept the mood light FROM TIME TO TIME AND wasn T so dreadfully serious DOT IN this way i actually enjoyed it MORE than babylon DOT jack o neill was A great CHARACTER WITH his sarcasm AND love OF homer simpson it s really too bad he slowly faded FROM the series IN later seasons DOT br br TO truly appreciate sg you should watch it FROM the beginning AND see how intricately the plots WORK DOT this coherence gives the SHOW exceptional staying POWER DOT AND IF you don T LIKE sg AFTER giving it A fair chance THEN sci fi IS probably NOT the genre FOR you DOT,Safe

692,jim carrey IS back TO much the same ROLE that he played IN the mask A timid guy who IS trying TO GET ahead IN the world but who seems TO be plagued WITH bad luck DOT even WHEN he tries TO help A homeless guy FROM being harassed BY A bunch OF hoodlums AND OF course they have TO be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires DOT IN that CASE it wasn T too hard TO predict that he was about TO have A handful OF angry hoodlums but i LIKE that the movie suggests that things LIKE that shouldn T be ignored DOT i M reminded OF the episode OF michael moore s brilliant the awful truth WHEN they had A man lay down ON the sidewalk AND pretend TO be dead AND see who would actually stop AND make sure he was okay DOT the results were NOT very promising so it s nice TO see someone IN the movies setting A good example DOT br br jim carrey plays the part OF bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems TO be falling apart DOT OR even better it seems TO be breaking up BY the blows OF bad luck LIKE an asteroid entering the atmosphere A little metaphor that comes up WHEN bruce miraculously finds himself A gigantic news story later IN the film DOT bruce IS nearly years OLD AND ALL he has TO SHOW FOR it IS A POSITION AS A news reporter OF the sort that reports ON such exciting news AS the LOCAL bakery that s seeking TO bake the world s biggest cookie DOT he s desperate TO obtain the job OF head anchor AT the tv station but he loses his cool ON live tv WHEN he hears that the job went TO his rival colleague DOT you have TO love how they TIME the revelation OF this news TO him seconds BEFORE his FIRST live report DOT needless TO say he loses his temper ON live tv IN one OF the funniest scenes OF the entire film DOT br br morgan freeman delivers A fantastic performance AS the man himself displaying A god whose infinite wisdom IS somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent AS an actor DOT he IS the kind OF god who takes his job very seriously but IN such A way AS TO advise his followers AS well AS the viewers OF this movie that there ARE times WHEN you need TO slow down AND DO SOME manual labor IN life DOT i love his line that SOME OF the happiest people IN the world come home smelling TO high heaven AT the END OF the DAY DOT there ARE A lot OF people IN the world maybe MORE than our SHARE IN america who ARE so absorbed BY their money AND their possessions AND their jobs AND everything that they completely lost touch WITH the NATURAL side OF themselves AS humans DOT br br one OF the biggest strengths IS that the movie IS able TO provide great advice TO people IN GENERAL about improving their lives AND this message IS clear AND acceptable regardless OF the viewer s religion DOT i FOR example tend TO reject organized religion IN ALL forms AND i see god AND satan TO be metaphors FOR different aspects OF nature AND human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived OR CONTINUE TO live DOT but despite the fact that i don T believe that god EXISTS AS an entity overseeing the universe OR AS A janitor dressed ALL IN white who mops the floors OF his downtown office IN his spare TIME i was able TO appreciate the messages that were delivered IN this movie DOT br br jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that TIES them ALL together AND makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come DOT IF you compare bruce almighty WITH movies LIKE ace ventura BOTH OF which i loved BY the way OR A lot OF what he did BEFORE he got INTO film it s amazing how far he s come DOT he has moved FROM cheesy tv comedy TO cheesy comedic films TO comedies that ARE truly intelligent AND meaningful LIKE this film AS well AS OTHERS LIKE the truman SHOW man ON the moon AND the majestic easily one OF his GREATEST films ever DOT jim carrey has unmistakably moved FROM the cheesy comedy OF his past TO become one OF the most important comic actors working today DOT br br jennifer aniston ALSO once again provides an excellent addition TO the movie AS she did IN the side splitting office SPACE AS bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated BY bruce s growing stress about his life AS well AS his negligence TO ask her TO marry him DOT there IS definitely SOME low brow comedy IN the film that doesn T really fit WITH the importance OF the film s meaning OR the quality OF the delivery such AS the dog reading the newspaper ON the toilet AND the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice TO see ace ventura s friend spike make A cameo appearance DOT AS stephen king very well knows it s ALWAYS nice TO see familiar CHARACTERS DOT it s almost LIKE seeing FAMILY again DOT br br bruce IS endowed WITH the powers OF god FOR A given PERIOD OF TIME so that he can understand life A BIT better AND he says A lot about himself WHEN he uses the powers ONLY FOR his own purposes rather than TO help ALL OF the people who pray TO him DOT the thing i love about this IS that LIKE i said BEFORE religion IS ABSENT FROM my life but i was able TO watch this AND learn A lot about myself AS well BY thinking about what kinds OF things i would have done had i been endowed WITH such powers DOT the movie allows us TO learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even MORE DOT br br the scenes that involve the news station ARE easily the funniest IN the entire film such AS the scene WHEN bruce loses his temper about the anchor POSITION the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried WITH an original birth certificate AND A complete SET OF dental records the scene WHERE bruce s rival colleague IS made TO GO nuts ON camera AND my favorites the ones AT the beginning AND the END involving the LOCAL bakery s cooking DOT the movie has plenty OF TIME FOR carrey TO deliver SOME excellent jokes such AS WHEN he says TO god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be REAL bashes AND TO be careful about drinking because ON OF him might need A ride home i ALSO loved the END WHEN he says that behind EVERY great man IS A woman rolling her eyes DOT A little too TRUE AND AS gallagher would ADD behind EVERY great man IS ALSO an amazed mother IN law DOT br br bruce almighty IS one OF the MORE memorable comedies TO have come OUT FOR quite A WHILE AND IS probably the ONLY directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious TO buy ON dvd TO ADD TO my personal collection DOT it IS A comedy written AND performed IN good taste but WITH enough relatively low brow humor TO keep the kids entertained DOT this IS A meaningful comedy FOR the whole FAMILY which IS becoming rarer AND rarer these days DOT IN A world that IS about TO be flogged WITH yet another american pie film AND another scary movie which ARE ONLY scary because OF their sheer barbarous idiocy it s nice TO see that there ARE still people making comedies worth watching DOT don T miss this one DOT,Safe

696,china o brien was an attempt TO make cynthia rothrock A star IN the united states DOT this golden harvet production was helmed BY veteran director robert clouse DOT sadly he was either lucky WITH enter the dragon OR he s lost his touch because he s NOT that great OF A director DOT the ONLY reason TO watch this movie IS TO see the fighting skills OF ms DOT rothrock AND richard norton DOT IF this movie was directed BY corey yuen OR hoi meng it could have been an ACTION classic INSTEAD OF A cheesy straight TO video ACTION flick DOT br br china o brien RETURNS home TO help OUT her dad DOT he s HAVING trouble WITH the LOCAL mob AND he needs her help DOT so she RETURNS home AND restores ORDER WITH the help OF two unlikely people DOT but will they be enough TO topple mister big AND his evil cronies br br IF you re A big cynthia rothrock fan THEN this movie s catered FOR you DOT i ONLY enjoyed the fighting scenes everything ELSE IS rubbish DOT why didn T raymond chow shell OUT A few shekels AND hired A top notch ACTION director br br recommended DOT,Safe
697,this film was hard TO GET A HOLD OF AND WHEN i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming DOT i mean this IS one OF the great stories OF the twentieth century an UNKNOWN man takes advantage OF the unsuspecting airline industry AND gets away WITH millions IN ransom WITHOUT hurting anyone OR bungling the attempt DOT WITH ALL OF this built IN interest how could anyone make such A lackluster talk laden flick OF this TRUE life EVENT DOT WHILE williams IS ALWAYS interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d DOT b DOT cooper persona was stereotypically heroic LIKE A movie star s what we GET IS A TYPE WITHOUT ANY engaging details OR insights INTO the mind OF A person daring enough AND clever enough TO have pulled it OFF DOT harrold practically steals the movie WITH her spunk AND pure beauty but the REAL letdown was IN the handling OF the plot AND the lame direction DOT shame ON this film FOR even existing DOT,Safe
698,this one AND her pilgrim soul ARE two OF my favorite episodes IN this NEW VERSION OF twilight ZONE DOT AS i mentioned IN my COMMENT ON the NEW series there s something lacking IN this NEW series DOT maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has TO be learned DOT it s A little BIT MORE mawkish AND sentimental than serling s VERSION DOT however this episode can be considered AS quite sentimental too DOT i think the appeal IS that NO matter what they DO the lovers can never unite DOT i remember i wasn T surprised BY the korean movie il mare later remade INTO the lake house DOT i think it s because i saw this episode FIRST so it ruined the impact OF the later film DOT,Safe

90,FOR me personally this film goes down IN my top four OF ALL TIME DOT NO exceptions DOT james cameron has proved himself TIME AND TIME again that he IS A master storyteller DOT through films such AS aliens the abyss AND BOTH terminators it IS clear that he was A brilliant AND confidant director AS far AS ACTION AND science fiction goes DOT he sees A story AND adds A strange quality TO the film DOT but titanic IS so much different TO his other strokes OF brilliance DOT the film IS exceptionally moving AND allows room FOR surprises plot development AND interesting CHARACTER developments IN A story that everyone knows DOT the story OF the famed voyager sinking ON her maiden voyage IS legend so the challenge was FOR cameron TO make A truthful interesting AND entertaining film about it DOT the acting IS wonderful AS leonardo dicaprio who plays jack AND kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight WITH the RELEASE OF this film AND IN most films i GET annoyed WHEN the supporting CHARACTERS aren T given A lot TO DO but IN this film it IS MORE purposeful because AS an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it IS quickly apparent that it IS rose s AND jack s story alone NO one ELSE DOT emotionally it IS entirely satisfying AND can LEAVE NO dry eye IN A theater OR home DOT the music has become iconic AND legendary DOT it IS composer james horner s finest soundtrack ever AND evokes so much FROM the film AND the audience DOT the song AFTER so LONG has become annoying but i still appreciate it FOR the phenomenon it IS AND this film IS DOT ONLY one problem the usual james cameron problem IS the dialogue which IS memorable but IN A bad way AS IN how cheesy it IS AT points but ALL that aside DOT james cameron has delivered A masterpiece AND A romantic epic that sweeps you away ON A journey OF A lifetime DOT my heart won T GO ON FROM this one DOT,Safe

98,titanic directed BY james cameron presents A fictional love story ON the historical setting OF the titanic DOT the plot IS SIMPLE noncomplicated OR NOT FOR those who love plots that twist AND turn

aristocratic young lady betrothed BY cal billy zane DOT early ON the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio A LOWER CLASS artist ON his way TO america AFTER winning his ticket aboard titanic IN A poker game DOT IF he wants something he goes AND gets it unlike the UPPER CLASS who ARE so concerned WITH their social worries DOT the two fall IN love AND the audience sees the sinking OF the titanic primarily through their eyes DOT br br the movie begins IN modern times WITH the exploration OF the wreck BY A GROUP searching FOR treasures that sunk WITH the titanic which has recently occurred DOT one OF the survivors OF the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard OF the exploration OF the wreck ON television AND IS flown TO the boat WHERE the SEARCH IS being led FROM TO tell OF what she remembers TO help the SEARCH DOT she gets TO telling her memory OF the one AND ONLY voyage OF the titanic DOT WITH this the scene shifts TO southhampton ireland WHERE the titanic SET sail FROM ON april AS ALL the passengers ARE boarding DOT AFTER another stop ON the irish coast titanic went OUT TO see ON its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound FOR NEW york DOT historically the FIRST few days OF the voyage went BY uneventful but the fictional plot OF the story IS developed during this TIME AS rose sees the hopeless entrapement OF an engagement that she IS IN TO the wealthy cal hockley AND falls IN love WITH third CLASS passenger jack dawson DOT captain smith alledgedly AS shown IN the movie was urged BY the white star line director TO increase the speed OF the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines AND receive extra publicity BY arriving IN NEW york ON thursday night AND NOT ON friday morning AS planned DOT smith THEN ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years OF experience TO stretch the titanic s legs OUT TO FULL speed DOT the titanic had reports that the waters IN the atlantic they were sailing IN were FULL OF icebergs but they ignored these warnings AND proceeded AT FULL speed AS shown IN the movie DOT ON april AT an iceberg was sighted DOT they attempted TO shut OFF the engines AND turn the ship OUT OF the PATH OF the iceberg but there was NOT enough TIME AND the ship hit the iceberg ON the starboard side AS depicted IN the film DOT the portrayal OF the many small holes IN the side OF the ship AND NOT one LARGE gash along the side IS accurate DOT the crew OF titanic sent OUT distress calls AND SET OFF distress rockets AS shown UNTIL WHEN the lights finally failed DOT the lights OF the california were spotted six miles away but they failed TO realize what was going ON AND did NOT respond TO titanic s many pleas FOR help DOT the california had tried earlier IN the DAY TO warn titanic OF the severe ice that had caused them TO stop their trip but titanic had brushed them OFF causing the california TO turn OFF its radio AND LEAVE the titanic ON its own DOT the FIRST CLASS women AND children were the FIRST AS depicted TO be put INTO the twenty lifeboats that were ON the ship DOT overwhelmingly the third CLASS passengers suffered the most amount OF deaths OF ANY CLASS AND the crew was hit hard IN this tragedy too DOT the word OF white star line employees AND FIRST CLASS passengers was believed OVER that OF SECOND AND third CLASS passengers WHEN authorities were trying TO gain information OF the sinking DOT ALSO the metal that was used TO build the titanic has been FOUND IN recent years UNDER conditions OF severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank TO be extremely brittle DOT overall the basic plot IS very accurate IN its portayal OF the events AND the times AT which these events took place ON the titanic DOT br br many OF the CHARACTERS IN the story were NOT REAL AND created simply FOR the purpose OF the movie OR AS composite CHARACTERS TO represent possible CHARACTERISTICS AND ideas OF people ON the ship DOT the core GROUP OF rose jack cal AND rose s mother ALL were fictional CHARACTERS added INTO the story AS they represent different GROUPS OF people FROM the TIME DOT yet many CHARACTERS such AS the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay AND ALL OF the titanic s officers were REAL DOT the maiden voyage was going TO be captain edward smith s LAST voyage anyway AS he planned TO retire afterwards DOT he had been A part OF the white star line since WHERE he worked his way up TO his status AS the millionaire s captain WHEN the titanic sunk DOT the portrayals OF the officers IS accurate AS ONLY four survived the tragedy EXCEPT FOR the officer who threatened TO kill ALL OF the passengers OF the ship WITH his pistol DOT he IS ON record AS acting heroicly AND was misportrayed TO the point that james cameron apologized AND evoked A monument IN his honor IN the officer s former canadian hometown DOT AS shown IN the movie there was A LANGUAGE problem BETWEEN the crew AND many OF the LOWER CLASS passengers FROM non english speaking nations DOT IN addition officer lowe was the ONLY officer who came back IN the lifeboat AS depicted DOT the OLD people shown IN their bed AS the water came IN their room were based ON the strauss DOT NOT wanting TO LEAVE her husband s side mrs DOT strauss refused TO GET IN her lifeboat AND died WITH her husband ON the titanic DOT furthermore mr DOT goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy AND smoking A cigar reportedly did GO OUT LIKE this dressed IN his best DOT the richest man ON the ship john jacob astor who OWNED most OF manhattan died nonetheless AS well but his much younger wife was saved IN A lifeboat DOT IN addition molly brown was saved AND later had medals made up FOR the crew OF the carpethia that picked the survivors OF titanic up FROM the water DOT her ticket ON the titanic had COST OVER four thousand dollars AND BY the END OF her life she ended up broke DOT ALL OF the interiors OF the ship were masterfully replacated down TO the LAST pieces OF china AND silverware DOT the gymnasium which IS hardly seen IS recreated perfectly WITH ALL OF the machines reproduced TO MATCH those seen IN OLD photographs DOT the wonderful outfits AND costuming were an excellent re creation OF the post victorian era OF DOT the rich AT this TIME practically ruled everything AS the women s suffrage movement had NOT quite gotten moving yet DOT women during this TIME often married FOR financial SECURITY AS rose was considering doing AND normally took A back seast status TO their husbands AS cal wished FOR rose TO DO DOT the rich did NOT take well TO NEW money such AS molly brown AS depicted DOT everything OF the TIME was very formal DOT women had TO be escorted TO dinner BY A male figure AS seen WITH IN the dining scenes DOT smoking was NOT very common among women OF the TIME but holders OF cigarettes which were just coming IN AT the TIME were used AS seen WITH rose IN the movie DOT men OF the TIME generally smoked cigars NOT cigarettes DOT women were constained physically BY their corsets AND socially BY society DOT although james cameron had NO background IN historical films he brought IN experts OF titanic coupled WITH two years spent CROSS REFERENCING the history OF the titanic AND few liberties were taken DOT the beautiful cinematography AND special effects ALSO helped TO make the film even MORE breathtaking DOT br br A recognizable message can be seen IN the movie titanic AS the people ON the ship had about three hours TO contemplate their demise DOT the director james cameron shows the various reactions TO this TIME OF crisis IN people s lives DOT everyone reacts differently AND he gets you TO think OF how you might have reacted had you been IN that situation ON the titanic ON that fateful night DOT IN addition this film IS A reflection OF the s WHEN it was produced AS it gives A look INTO the wreck OF the titanic DOT ONLY IN the past fifteen years has the site OF the actual titanic been FOUND AND explored DOT this movie was able TO give us A deeper look INTO A disaster that many would NOT have viewed DOT however the moral question OF whether people today should be taking treasures FROM the wreck OF an underwater graveyard IS posed DOT there have been attempts TO stop treasure seeking missions such AS the one portrayed IN titanic but ALL have failed DOT AS it stands today anyone can make A voyage TO the titanic AND take whatever valuables they AS portrayed IN the film showing the GENERAL VALUES OF our TIME ON this matter DOT br br technically the film IS very well done DOT TO GET footage OF the wreck AT the bottom OF the ocean it took twelve dives TO GET ALL OF the footage needed FOR the movie DOT IN addition A special camera had TO be created TO withstand the intense pressure AT the bottom OF the ocean DOT cameron did NOT plan ON USING the probe TO GO AS far inside titanic AS anyone has IN the years since the ship sunk but it worked OUT that this provided an UNIQUE perspective INTO the ship DOT furthermore throughout the film fade ins AND outs FROM the wreck OF titanic TO the scene OF titanic during its actual voyage DOT this shift BETWEEN the modern scene TO the past scene during the voyage works AS an excellent transition that makes the story easy TO follow IN aclear manner DOT AT the very beginning OF the movie A septune recreation IS used TO recreate the scene WHEN the actual people LEFT the european coast ON titanic giving it distinction FROM the rest OF the events OF the film DOT br br titanic plays almost LIKE A historical biography AND IS LIKE A WORK OF art A TRUE epic DOT LIKE most history novels we know the ending but it doesn T take away FROM the wonderful treats that can be FOUND IN this picture DOT certain aspects OF this film ARE academy award material INCLUDING costuming sound cintematography AND editing DOT IF you LIKE interesting CHARACTERS that will give you an insight INTO the life OF CHARACTERS IN the early s AND how they face disaster THEN this movie definitely IS FOR you DOT br br,Safe

AND you realize this esoteric dream IS A very REAL nightmare OF sloppiness AND incompetence DOT WHILE it s entirely possible that NO movie could compete WITH the finished perfect VERSION EACH OF us has imagined OVER the years it really should have been A thrill TO finally see this project DOT AND it IS ONLY A very few times DOT br br you know things ARE shaky WHEN the very FIRST BIT OF TEXT ON screen looks LIKE home brew computer graphics DOT but THEN we START seeing NEW footage alternates FROM superman the movie FOR the trial AND that FIRST BIT OF hesitation fades away DOT hey this IS pretty neat things ARE alright FOR these few fleeting moments UNTIL we see footage FROM stm intermixed WITH NEW effects FOR this project AND it doesn T convince AT ALL DOT AND FROM this point ON it never ever lets up DOT it s probably NOT RIGHT TO judge A movie because OF bad visual effects but WHEN this IS supposedly the direct follow up TO A movie whose tag line was you ll believe A man can fly it s difficult TO believe anything shown ON screen here DOT the best effects IN this ARE FROM the original productions DOT br br another issue WITH this re cut DOT A lot OF it just doesn T make sense DOT the ONLY reason ANY OF it really works IS because we ve ALL seen the theatrical VERSION OF superman ii A movie that does make sense DOT lester s superman ii fills IN the holes OF this assembly DOT part OF this could be because donner didn T GET TO complete shooting the other part could be because the makers OF this project were intent ON USING AS little lester material AS possible DOT what we END up WITH IS an assembly OF footage that makes superman iv look airtight AND coherent DOT br br AFTER viewing this one gets the sense that WHILE lester was faithful AND comfortable USING donner material michael thau AND his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed BY lester DOT the best scenes IN the donner cut ARE the ones lifted relatively intact FROM the released VERSION OF superman ii DOT that includes the moon SEQUENCE AND the diner SEQUENCE NOT ironically BOTH were filmed BY donner DOT but anything ELSE FROM that movie filmed BY lester IS re edited IN such A hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem LIKE A ham fisted know NOTHING DOT WHILE lester honored the donner material lester here IS thrown UNDER the bus DOT br br so IS there anything good IN this RELEASE well marlon brando IS IN it AND that s neat TO see DOT IN fact watching ANY OF the material shot BY donner IS neat since it was ALL filmed AT the same TIME AS superman the movie DOT but that ONLY highlights the problems OF this RELEASE DOT ANY OF the major scenes really just lois jumping AND scenes WITH marlon brando would have been better served AS completed scenes IN A deleted scenes SECTION DOT INSTEAD they ARE shoe horned INTO A nonsensical narrative WITH inferior performances many alternate takes FROM familiar scenes ARE used sloppy edits AND bad decisions DOT br br watch the opening scene AT the daily planet DOT why ARE we looking AT jackie cooper s back AS he calls FOR lois AND clark AT the END why DO we have lois walking INTO her dark apartment ONLY TO have that followed BY jackie cooper walking INTO A dark bathroom turning the lights ON i was INITIALLY confused BY this because i expected TO see lois DOT the entire assembly IS filled WITH questionable choices LIKE this DOT br br battle scenes ARE A mess too WITH NO geography BETWEEN cuts DOT it s just random ACTION DOT OF course the major ACTION scenes were shot BY lester AND his material IS ONLY used AS A bridge TO the NEXT SET OF donner outtakes OR alternates DOT they should have used MORE OF lester s footage but probably had too much pride TO admit that DOT br br the sloppiness extends TO the military missile AS well DOT AS noted elsewhere the missile shown IN the donner cut bears the designation xk WHILE we ALL know it s the xk A blind man IN stm knows that the producers OF this assembly who tried so hard TO honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes IN AND that mistake IS indicative OF the quality OF the entire production DOT FOR ALL the supposed care that was put INTO this the FINAL product has an air OF shoddiness TO it that IS inescapable DOT br br the entire affair would probably be easier TO digest IF warner s didn T make this A separate RELEASE here IN the states DOT AS it IS we re expected TO pay FOR what IS essentially A bonus disc OF deleted scenes WITH A play ALL OPTION DOT it s really ONLY worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but AFTER that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet FOR dust AND little ELSE DOT i know AFTER my experience OF watching this i had NEW RESPECT FOR lester s VERSION DOT it s BY NO means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were IN the script that stand OUT here IN bold relief DOT he managed TO make A movie that has entertained FOR many years AND will CONTINUE TO DO so WHILE this NEW re cut will most likely ONLY be remembered AS A footnote IN that films history DOT,Safe

series AND movies DOT AS far AS the series goes they DO A pretty good job IN bringing the fun AND magic OF the japanese versions TO television DOT so what IS their problem WHEN it comes TO the movies honestly now i have seen ALL three pokmon movies IN japanese AND i will definitely be seeing the fourth one DOT they ARE excellent movies DOT they ARE ALL enjoyable AND fun TO watch DOT AND AFTER seeing pokmon IN theaters i can T help but wonder how these american producers READ the japanese scripts DOT the way it appears it seems that they READ AND see something that says INSERT EMPTY moral here IN big bold faced letters DOT it definitely appears that way AS they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used ON msb extreme sarcasm there AND created this crap DOT br br possible spoilers FROM here ON br br well i guess i should FIRST talk about pikachu s rescue adventure DOT my FIRST gripe WITH this came WITH NO narration DOT i guess they got enough bad COMMENTS ON the pokdex narration that plagued pikachu s vacation AND INSTEAD OF going WITH A caring gentle woman s voice AS appeared IN pikachu NO natsu yasumi AND pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration ALL together DOT this wouldn T have been A problem EXCEPT FOR one thing DOT did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn T let togepi GO UNTIL the END possibly the fans but i M sure NOT the parents DOT THEN there s the theme song DOT i couldn T help but roll my eyes AT this one DOT the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou AND was sung BY japanese children DOT it was fun AND enjoyable DOT this one nauseating DOT now one OF my favorite parts OF the short was the dancing kireihana DOT nice music fun TO watch DOT that s changed WITH the bellossom DOT the music sucked FOR one but ON top OF that they had ALL the pokmon talk during the music which turned OUT TO be jumpy annoying AND just unnecessary DOT oh AND THEN there s the poliwhirl who thinks he s A poliwrath DOT you d think that guys that WORK WITH these CHARACTERS constantly would AT LEAST learn what they ARE DOT basically NOT much could save this little ill fated dub which IS very unfortunate considering its potential DOT but i haven T touched ON the worst OF it yet DOT br br you d think that the warning signs would ve been apparent TO me WHEN i received my issue OF nintendo POWER DOT FOR SOME unfathomable reason i had been PLACING SOME faith IN kids AND the wb DOT my thoughts were well they screwed up ON the FIRST movie but the SECOND IS different AS far AS the theme goes so they should DO well DOT that IN mind i just didn T pay attention TO the warning signs i encountered IN the theaters WHEN the trailers said you will believe that one person can make ALL the difference DOT WITH the way they said that AT EVERY turn i was hoping that this would NOT turn INTO A moral fest LIKE msb did AT the END OF the english VERSION DOT THEN comes nintendo POWER IN which i see ALL my fears realized IN the words the main feature the POWER OF one DOT AT that point i became A BIT MORE uneasy DOT the POWER OF one NOT A good sign DOT however i still kept SOME OF my FALSE faith DOT big mistake DOT br br sitting IN the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved IN japanese being turned INTO complete AND utter junk DOT i hear COMMENTS that say it was better because the moral was MORE subtle DOT i can see A point IN that since they didn T pander this thing repeating it OVER AND OVER LIKE IN msb DOT however it did MORE damage than anything ELSE IN this movie DOT FIRST OF ALL the legend that was READ throughout was changed A BIT TO READ the world turns TO ash DOT ah hah DOT so ash IS the chosen one whatever DOT IN the japanese VERSION the inhabitants OF arshia needed A pokmon trainer TO carry OUT their traditional ceremony DOT this TIME he s the chosen one DOT A greater way that this did damage was TO lugia DOT lugia was one OF the coolest CHARACTERS IN A pokmon movie DOT DOT DOT DOT WHEN the movie was about lugia DOT IN this one lugia IS forced TO take A back seat TO ash DOT IN the scene WHERE they re flying back TO the main island lugia AND ash ARE discussing the conditions OF lugia s existence NOT that ash IS going TO make ALL the difference DOT overall IN this category ash wasn T really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped BY many along the way DOT br br A lot OF the other stuff IS kind OF nit picking DOT furura s flute song wasn T nearly AS sweet AND enjoyable AS the japanese one DOT jirarudan s speech TO them saying his collection started WITH A mew card ugh DOT even worse misty s outrage originally concerned the way moltres AND zapdos were being held DOT why didn T you put them IN pokballs WHEN you caught them this IS LIKE caging them TO be displayed DOT much different FROM whining about him thinking pokmon ARE things TO be collected LIKE stamps DOT IF there were ANY REAL redeeming VALUES IN this they came FROM team rocket DOT SOME pretty funny lines DOT NOT really TO make me laugh OUT loud but MORE TO make me giggle AND slightly ease the pains IN my stomach DOT well that was officially the LAST american pokmon movie i M going TO see DOT i ve imported the third one AND find it very enjoyable DOT i would rather NOT see another japanese movie be ruined IN the same fashion AS the FIRST

their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements A band OF hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played BY donald pleasance here giving one OF his most ridiculous performances AND that s saying something AND IN the tradition OF many previous western SET romantic comedies EACH other DOT br br during the course OF their misadventures the two opposites ARE inevitably AND predictably attracted TO EACH other AND eventually END up getting it ON WHILE gant has A freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg NO less IN what was surely the ONLY conveniently located cave FOR AT LEAST A twelve mile radius that wasn T filled WITH rattlesnakes mountain lions OR who knows what TO say NOTHING OF the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy WITH such A primo apartment there i GO thinking IN nyc REAL estate terms again DOT br br realizing that their love could never flourish outside OF the cave cresta leaves gant AND makes it TO the fort BY herself ONLY TO discover that the moron IN charge won T spare A couple OF men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs ALL available personnel TO launch an attack ON the nearby cheyenne village AND once cresta gets wind OF that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby TO be AND makes A beeline straight TO the cheyenne TO warn them OF what s coming DOT br br what happens NEXT IS what gained the film its infamy it turns OUT that ALL the wacky misadventures AND squabbling were ALL just A LEAD IN TO A hideous reenactment OF the sand creek massacre an orgy OF rape torture AND GENERAL sadistic evil perpetrated IN the NAME OF keeping the country clean AND almost forty years AFTER its RELEASE this SEQUENCE still disturbs AND nauseates FOR its sheer cruelty DOT children ARE trampled beneath the hooves OF charging horses OR impaled ON bayonets unarmed people ARE beheaded A nice effect i have TO admit women ARE stripped AND pawed BY gangs OF slavering brutes THEN raped AND mutilated IN one truly sickening INSTANCE A naked native woman puts up too much OF A fight so her rapist INSTEAD decides TO cut OFF her breasts which we thankfully ONLY see the START OF BEFORE the camera moves ON TO chronicle SOME other hideous act AND scores OF innocent people ARE shot AND dismembered their compone nt parts impaled ON pikes AND waved about IN victorious celebration OR kept AS the most ghoulish

exploitative manner IN which the atrocities ARE depicted DOT br br i M ALL IN favor OF westerns that don T shy away FROM honest portrayals OF how the west was won OR stolen IF truth be told but this

battle OF the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant IS AND manages TO look hot IN her tasty red calico poncho WITH NO undies but that ALL goes OUT the WINDOW WHEN donald pleasance shows up WITH an unintentionally hilarious pair OF buck toothed dentures AND our heroes must figure OUT how TO ESCAPE FROM his murderous clutches IN A sub plot that goes nowhere ALL OF which culminates IN the aforementioned apocalyptic climax DOT ANY one OF those tacks would have been okay FOR A coherent film but the END RESULT IS A slapdash mess that milked the horrors OF its FINAL ten minutes FOR ALL they were worth IN the film s promotion AND poster imagery DOT br br but BY trying TO be ALL things TO ALL audiences soldier blue ends up AS an incoherent preachy mulligan stew OF presumably well intentioned political correctness but IF they were going TO tell the story OF the sand creek massacre wouldn T it have been A good idea TO have SOME indian CHARACTERS who were MORE than just walk ons WITH murphy brown acting AS their mouthpiece we GET TO know absolutely NOTHING OF the people who GET wiped OUT solely FOR what appears TO be A crass ploy TO lure gorehound

659,WHEN A movie OF A book seems pointless AND incomprehensible the cause can invariably be FOUND IN the book either it was pointless TO START WITH OR the point IS one NOT easily conveyed TO film OR the movie missed the point which IS the most frequent OF these results AND the easiest TO happen especially WHEN the point IS one NOT easily DEFINED DOT the book morvern callar has A point EVERY reader OF the book must have felt this AND felt AS IF he had gotten it but i suspect most OF them could NOT STATE it IN words DOT i M NOT sure i can myself but perhaps it comes TO this OR something LIKE it things come things GO such IS life but we carry ON OR AT ANY rate SOME OF us people LIKE morvern DO DOT NO doubt A MORE erudite critic could construct A MORE adequate definition DOT but the important fact IS that there IS A point possibly the SUM OF the entire story IS the point AND that this would have been the main thing TO keep IN VIEW AND TO carry OVER IN adapting the story TO film DOT the maker OF this film evidently missed the point AND doesn T substitute one OF her own AND so the film IS about NOTHING DOT br br this IS NOT the usual complaint OF A book lover that his favorite TEXT has been violated DOT the merit OF the book IS something i conceded grudgingly IN reading it i FOUND it A bloody nuisance AND an occasion FOR kicking the author IN the pants AND getting him IN TO finish the job properly DOT the narrative IS supposed TO be the WORK OF the half educated morvern but that illusion IS constantly dispelled BY A dozen different TYPES OF literary effect AS IF the author were poking AT her WITH his pen there ARE inconsistencies OF STYLE AND tone AS IF different sections had been composed AT different times AND ANY conclusions i could reach about morvern had TO remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended AND which he did NOT FOR INSTANCE despite morvern s own SELF characterization AS A raver am i wrong that IN the END she remains essentially A working CLASS scots girl AND beneath her wrapping OF music downloads NOT so different FROM those OF generations past IN ANY CASE despite my irritation AT the author i couldn T deny that his book stuck WITH me AND what i couldn T GET OUT OF my head was his CHARACTER s attitude her angle ON the world which was almost AS vivid AS A goya portrait DOT morvern IS the kind OF person who s ALWAYS encountering situations AT once rather comic AND rather horrible occasionally she invites them but MORE often they land ON her LIKE flies so that much OF her life consists OF A kind OF gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical AND unconsciously philosophical AND that doesn T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE it idiosyncratically enough DOT the complex OF incidents AND OF morvern s responses TO them ARE the substance OF the book AND its achievement IN exposing A CROSS SECTION OF existence it would be difficult TO illuminate otherwise FOR ALL my dislike OF the book i can see this DOT br br the morvern just described IS NOT the morvern OF the movie OR IF it IS most OF her IS kept offscreen DOT an actress who might have been A good fit FOR the CHARACTER had she been the RIGHT age AT the RIGHT TIME IS angharad rees FROM the OLD tv series poldark DOT samantha morton THEN would seem LIKE good casting she s rather the same sort OF actress AND IN one OF her earlier movies jesus son she played A girl who WITH A few adjustments could have been turned INTO this one DOT unfortunately AS the film turned OUT she doesn T have the CHARACTER FROM the book TO play DOT FOR one thing the book IS one that IF it IS TO be dramatized virtually cries OUT FOR monologues BY the main CHARACTER TO the audience WITHOUT her COMMENTS her perspective her voice the story loses most OF its meaning DOT it has lost MORE OF it IN that the adaptor has expurgated it OF its comic AND horrible elements the most memorable incidents FROM the book ARE curtailed BEFORE they turn grotty AND so morvern s responses whether OF amusement OR distaste depending ON her mood ARE missing too AND the incidents NO longer have A reason FOR being IN the story DOT IN short the filmmaker chose FOR SOME reason TO turn A brisk edgy serio comic novel INTO A genteel art tv film AND chose AS her typical image one OF ms DOT morton languishing IN A artistically shaded melancholy AS IF the outing morvern signs up FOR were A tour OF the stations OF the CROSS DOT this isn T AT ALL what the book OR the morvern OF the book was about DOT FOR another thing the morvern OF the movie isn T scottish the actress said IN an interview she hadn T had TIME TO study up the accent AND she ought TO be it s important that she her FAMILY AND her mates ARE ALL FROM A single place DOT AND finally the film IS missing the END OF the story morvern s spending ALL she has AND coming home TO icy darkness it s winter the dam has frozen the POWER has gone OUT AND the pub IS dark DOT minus this AND minus ALL OF the rest what

be breaking up BY the blows OF bad luck LIKE an asteroid entering the atmosphere A little metaphor that comes up WHEN bruce miraculously finds himself A gigantic news story later IN the film DOT bruce IS nearly years OLD AND ALL he has TO SHOW FOR it IS A POSITION AS A news reporter OF the sort that reports ON such exciting news AS the LOCAL bakery that s seeking TO bake the world s biggest cookie DOT he s desperate TO obtain the job OF head anchor AT the tv station but he loses his cool ON live tv WHEN he hears that the job went TO his rival colleague DOT you have TO love how they TIME the revelation OF this news TO him seconds BEFORE his FIRST live report DOT needless TO say he loses his temper ON live tv IN one OF the funniest scenes OF the entire film DOT br br morgan freeman delivers A fantastic performance AS the man himself displaying A god whose infinite wisdom IS somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent AS an actor DOT he IS the kind OF god who takes his job very seriously but IN such A way AS TO advise his followers AS well AS the viewers OF this movie that there ARE times WHEN you need TO slow down AND DO SOME manual labor IN life DOT i love his line that SOME OF the happiest people IN the world come home smelling TO high heaven AT the END OF the DAY DOT there ARE A lot OF people IN the world maybe MORE than our SHARE IN america who ARE so absorbed BY their money AND their possessions AND their jobs AND everything that they completely lost touch WITH the NATURAL side OF themselves AS humans DOT br br one OF the biggest strengths IS that the movie IS able TO provide great advice TO people IN GENERAL about improving their lives AND this message IS clear AND acceptable regardless OF the viewer s religion DOT i FOR example tend TO reject organized religion IN ALL forms AND i see god AND satan TO be metaphors FOR different aspects OF nature AND human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived OR CONTINUE TO live DOT but despite the fact that i don T believe that god EXISTS AS an entity overseeing the universe OR AS A janitor dressed ALL IN white who mops the floors OF his downtown office IN his spare TIME i was able TO appreciate the messages that were delivered IN this movie DOT br br jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that TIES them ALL together AND makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come DOT IF you compare bruce almighty WITH movies LIKE ace ventura BOTH OF which i loved BY the way OR A lot OF what he did BEFORE he got INTO film it s amazing how far he s come DOT he has moved FROM cheesy tv comedy TO cheesy comedic films TO comedies that ARE truly intelligent AND meaningful LIKE this film AS well AS OTHERS LIKE the truman SHOW man ON the moon AND the majestic easily one OF his GREATEST films ever DOT jim carrey has unmistakably moved FROM the cheesy comedy OF his past TO become one OF the most important comic actors working today DOT br br jennifer aniston ALSO once again provides an excellent addition TO the movie AS she did IN the side splitting office SPACE AS bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated BY bruce s growing stress about his life AS well AS his negligence TO ask her TO marry him DOT there IS definitely SOME low brow comedy IN the film that doesn T really fit WITH the importance OF the film s meaning OR the quality OF the delivery such AS the dog reading the newspaper ON the toilet AND the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice TO see ace ventura s friend spike make A cameo appearance DOT AS stephen king very well knows it s ALWAYS nice TO see familiar CHARACTERS DOT it s almost LIKE seeing FAMILY again DOT br br bruce IS endowed WITH the powers OF god FOR A given PERIOD OF TIME so that he can understand life A BIT better AND he says A lot about himself WHEN he uses the powers ONLY FOR his own purposes rather than TO help ALL OF the people who pray TO him DOT the thing i love about this IS that LIKE i said BEFORE religion IS ABSENT FROM my life but i was able TO watch this AND learn A lot about myself AS well BY thinking about what kinds OF things i would have done had i been endowed WITH such powers DOT the movie allows us TO learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even MORE DOT br br the scenes that involve the news station ARE easily the funniest IN the entire film such AS the scene WHEN bruce loses his temper about the anchor POSITION the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried WITH an original birth certificate AND A complete SET OF dental records the scene WHERE bruce s rival colleague IS made TO GO nuts ON camera AND my favorites the ones AT the beginning AND the END involving the LOCAL bakery s cooking DOT the movie has plenty OF TIME FOR carrey TO deliver SOME excellent jokes such AS WHEN he says TO god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be REAL bashes AND TO be careful about drinking because ON OF him might need A ride home i ALSO loved the END WHEN he says that behind EVERY great man IS A woman rolling her eyes DOT A little too TRUE AND AS gallagher would ADD behind EVERY great man IS ALSO an amazed mother IN law DOT br br bruce almighty IS one OF the MORE memorable comedies TO have come OUT FOR quite A WHILE AND IS probably the ONLY directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious TO buy ON dvd TO ADD TO my personal collection DOT it IS A comedy written AND performed IN good taste but WITH enough relatively low brow humor TO keep the kids entertained DOT this IS A meaningful comedy FOR the whole FAMILY which IS becoming rarer AND rarer these days DOT IN A world that IS about TO be flogged WITH yet another american pie

699,AS someone who likes chase scenes AND was really intrigued BY this fascinating TRUE life tale i was optimistic heading INTO this film but too many obstacles got INTO the way OF the good story it should have been DOT br br the bad i M A fan OF robert duvall AND many OF the CHARACTERS he has played but his ROLE here IS A dull one AS an insurance investigator DOT br br the dialog IS insipid AND the pretty kathryn harrold IS REAL garbage mouth DOT FROM what i READ there were several directors replacing EACH other ON this film AND that s too bad DOT you can tell things aren T RIGHT WITH the story DOT i couldn T GET involved WITH TREAT williams portrayal OF cooper either DOT he should have been fascinating but he wasn T IN this movie DOT it s ALSO kind OF A sad COMMENT that A guy committing A crime IS SOME sort OF folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting FOR the guy too DOT br br NOT everything was disappointing DOT i can T complain about the scenery FROM the lush green forests OF oregon TO the desert IN arizona DOT br br i d LIKE TO see this movie re made AND done better because it IS A one OF A kind story DOT,Safe

april AS ALL the passengers ARE boarding DOT AFTER another stop ON the irish coast titanic went OUT TO see ON its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound FOR NEW york DOT historically the FIRST few days OF the voyage went BY uneventful but the fictional plot OF the story IS developed during this TIME AS rose sees the hopeless entrapement OF an engagement that she IS IN TO the wealthy cal hockley AND falls IN love WITH third CLASS passenger jack dawson DOT captain smith alledgedly AS shown IN the movie was urged BY the white star line director TO increase the speed OF the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines AND receive extra publicity BY arriving IN NEW york ON thursday night AND NOT ON friday morning AS planned DOT smith THEN ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years OF experience TO stretch the titanic s legs OUT TO FULL speed DOT the titanic had reports that the waters IN the atlantic they were sailing IN were FULL OF icebergs but they ignored

side IS accurate DOT the crew OF titanic sent OUT distress calls AND SET OFF distress rockets AS shown UNTIL WHEN the lights finally failed DOT the lights OF the california were spotted six miles away

TO stop their trip but titanic had brushed them OFF causing the california TO turn OFF its radio AND LEAVE the titanic ON its own DOT the FIRST CLASS women AND children were the FIRST AS depicted TO be put INTO the twenty lifeboats that were ON the ship DOT overwhelmingly the third CLASS passengers suffered the most amount OF deaths OF ANY CLASS AND the crew was hit hard IN this tragedy too DOT the word OF white star line employees AND FIRST CLASS passengers was believed OVER that OF SECOND AND third CLASS passengers WHEN authorities were trying TO gain information OF the sinking DOT ALSO the metal that was used TO build the titanic has been FOUND IN recent years UNDER conditions OF severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank TO be extremely brittle DOT overall the basic plot IS very accurate IN its portayal OF the events AND the times AT which these events took place ON the titanic DOT br br many OF the CHARACTERS IN the story were NOT REAL AND created simply FOR the purpose OF the movie OR AS composite CHARACTERS TO represent possible CHARACTERISTICS AND ideas OF people ON the ship DOT the core GROUP OF rose jack cal AND rose s mother ALL were fictional CHARACTERS added INTO the story AS they represent different GROUPS OF people FROM the TIME DOT yet many CHARACTERS such AS the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay AND ALL OF the titanic s officers were REAL DOT the maiden voyage was going TO be captain edward smith s LAST voyage anyway AS he planned TO retire afterwards DOT he had been A part OF the white star line since WHERE he worked his way up TO his status AS the millionaire s captain WHEN the titanic sunk DOT the portrayals OF the officers IS accurate AS ONLY four survived the tragedy EXCEPT FOR the officer who threatened TO kill ALL OF the passengers OF the ship WITH his pistol DOT he IS ON record AS acting heroicly AND was misportrayed TO the point that james cameron apologized AND evoked A monument IN his honor IN the officer s former canadian hometown DOT AS shown IN the movie there was A LANGUAGE problem BETWEEN the crew AND many

titanic coupled WITH two years spent CROSS REFERENCING the history OF the titanic AND few liberties were taken DOT the beautiful cinematography AND special effects ALSO helped TO make the film even MORE breathtaking DOT br br A recognizable message can be seen IN the movie titanic AS the people ON the ship had about three hours TO contemplate their demise DOT the director james cameron shows the various reactions TO this TIME OF crisis IN people s lives DOT everyone reacts differently AND he gets you TO think OF how you might have reacted had you been IN that situation ON the titanic ON that fateful night DOT IN addition this film IS A reflection OF the s WHEN it was produced AS it gives A look INTO the wreck OF the titanic DOT ONLY IN the past fifteen years has the site OF the actual titanic been FOUND AND explored DOT this movie was able TO give us A deeper look INTO A disaster that many would NOT have viewed DOT however the moral question OF whether people today should be taking treasures FROM the wreck OF an underwater graveyard IS posed DOT there have been attempts TO stop treasure seeking missions such AS the one portrayed IN titanic but ALL have failed DOT AS it stands today anyone can make A voyage TO the titanic AND take whatever valuables they AS portrayed IN the film showing the GENERAL VALUES OF our TIME ON this matter DOT br br technically the film IS very well done DOT TO GET footage OF the wreck AT the bottom OF the ocean it took twelve dives TO GET ALL OF the footage needed FOR the movie DOT IN addition A special camera had TO be created TO withstand the intense pressure AT the bottom OF the ocean DOT cameron did NOT plan ON USING the probe TO GO AS far inside titanic AS anyone has IN the years since the ship sunk but it worked OUT that this provided an UNIQUE perspective INTO the ship DOT furthermore throughout the film fade ins AND outs FROM the wreck OF titanic TO the scene OF titanic during its actual voyage DOT this shift BETWEEN the modern scene TO the past scene during the voyage works AS an excellent transition that makes the story easy TO follow IN aclear manner DOT AT the very beginning OF the movie A septune recreation IS used TO recreate the scene WHEN the actual people LEFT the european coast ON titanic giving it distinction FROM the rest OF the events OF the film DOT br br titanic plays almost LIKE A historical biography AND IS LIKE A WORK OF art A TRUE epic DOT LIKE most history novels we know the ending but it doesn T take away FROM the wonderful treats that can be FOUND IN this picture DOT certain aspects OF this film ARE academy award material INCLUDING costuming sound cintematography AND editing DOT IF you LIKE interesting CHARACTERS that will give you an insight INTO the life OF CHARACTERS IN the early s AND how they face disaster THEN this movie definitely IS FOR you DOT br br,Safe

127,superman ii the richard donner cut should be A fan s dream come TRUE DOT AT LONG LAST footage ONLY seen IN photos AND scenes that ONLY existed ON the printed page would finally come TO life DOT A director that was unable TO complete his vision would have the opportunity TO have his vision restored DOT it seems LIKE A winning situation DOT AND THEN you START watching this assembly OF footage AND you realize this esoteric dream IS A very REAL nightmare OF sloppiness AND incompetence DOT WHILE it s entirely possible that NO movie could compete WITH the finished perfect VERSION EACH OF us has imagined OVER the years it really should have been A thrill TO finally see this project DOT AND it IS ONLY A very few times DOT br br you know things ARE shaky WHEN the very FIRST BIT OF TEXT ON screen looks LIKE home brew computer graphics DOT but THEN we START seeing NEW footage alternates FROM superman the movie FOR the trial AND that FIRST BIT OF hesitation fades away DOT hey this IS pretty neat things ARE alright FOR these few fleeting moments UNTIL we see footage FROM stm intermixed WITH NEW effects FOR this project AND it doesn T convince AT ALL DOT AND FROM this point ON it never ever lets up DOT it s probably NOT RIGHT TO judge A movie because OF bad visual effects but WHEN this IS supposedly the direct follow up TO A movie whose tag line was you ll believe A man can fly it s difficult TO believe anything shown ON screen here DOT the best effects IN this ARE FROM the original productions DOT br br another issue WITH this re cut DOT A lot OF it just doesn T make sense DOT the ONLY reason ANY OF it really works IS because we ve ALL seen the theatrical VERSION OF superman ii A movie that does make sense DOT lester s superman ii fills IN the holes OF this assembly DOT part OF this could be because donner didn T GET TO complete shooting the other part could be because the makers OF this project were intent ON USING AS little lester material AS possible DOT what we END up WITH IS an assembly OF footage that makes superman iv look airtight AND coherent DOT br br AFTER viewing this one gets the sense that WHILE lester was faithful AND comfortable USING donner material michael thau AND his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed BY lester DOT the best scenes IN the donner cut ARE the ones lifted relatively intact FROM the released VERSION OF superman ii DOT that includes the moon SEQUENCE AND the diner SEQUENCE NOT ironically BOTH were filmed BY donner DOT but anything ELSE FROM that movie filmed BY lester IS re edited IN such A hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem LIKE A ham fisted know NOTHING DOT WHILE lester honored the donner material lester here IS thrown UNDER the bus DOT br br so IS there anything good IN this RELEASE well marlon brando IS IN it AND that s neat TO see DOT IN fact watching ANY OF the material shot BY donner IS neat since it was ALL filmed AT the same TIME AS superman the movie DOT but that ONLY highlights the problems OF this RELEASE DOT ANY OF the major scenes really just lois jumping AND scenes WITH marlon brando would have been better served AS completed scenes IN A deleted scenes SECTION DOT INSTEAD they ARE shoe horned INTO A nonsensical narrative WITH inferior performances many alternate takes FROM familiar scenes ARE used sloppy edits AND bad decisions DOT br br watch the opening scene AT the daily planet DOT why ARE we looking AT jackie cooper s back AS he calls FOR lois AND clark AT the END why DO we have lois walking INTO her dark apartment ONLY TO have that followed BY jackie cooper walking INTO A dark bathroom turning the lights ON i was INITIALLY confused BY this because i expected TO see lois DOT the entire assembly IS filled WITH questionable choices LIKE this DOT br br battle scenes ARE A mess too WITH NO geography BETWEEN cuts DOT it s just random ACTION DOT OF course the major ACTION scenes were shot BY lester AND his material IS ONLY used AS A bridge TO the NEXT SET OF donner outtakes OR alternates DOT they should have used MORE OF lester s footage but probably had too much pride TO admit that DOT br br the sloppiness extends TO the military missile AS well DOT AS noted elsewhere the missile shown IN the donner cut bears the designation xk WHILE we ALL know it s the xk A blind man IN stm knows that the producers OF this assembly who tried so hard TO honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes IN AND that mistake IS indicative OF the quality OF the entire production DOT FOR ALL the supposed care that was put INTO this the FINAL product has an air OF shoddiness TO it that IS inescapable DOT br br the entire affair would probably be easier TO digest IF warner s didn T make this A separate RELEASE here IN the states DOT AS it IS we re expected TO pay FOR what IS essentially A bonus disc OF deleted scenes WITH A play ALL OPTION DOT it s really ONLY worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but AFTER that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet FOR dust AND little ELSE DOT i know AFTER my experience OF watching this i had NEW RESPECT FOR lester s VERSION DOT it s BY NO means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were IN the script that stand OUT here IN bold relief DOT he managed TO make A movie that has entertained FOR many years AND will CONTINUE TO DO so WHILE this NEW re cut will most likely ONLY be remembered AS A footnote IN that films history DOT,Safe

seeing pokmon IN theaters i can T help but wonder how these american producers READ the japanese scripts DOT the way it appears it seems that they READ AND see something that says INSERT EMPTY moral

there s the theme song DOT i couldn T help but roll my eyes AT this one DOT the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou AND was sung BY japanese children DOT it was fun AND enjoyable DOT this

turn i was hoping that this would NOT turn INTO A moral fest LIKE msb did AT the END OF the english VERSION DOT THEN comes nintendo POWER IN which i see ALL my fears realized IN the words the main

theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved IN japanese being turned INTO complete AND utter junk DOT i hear COMMENTS that say it was better because the moral was MORE subtle DOT i can see A point IN that since they didn T pander this thing repeating it OVER AND OVER LIKE IN msb DOT however it did MORE damage than anything ELSE IN this movie DOT FIRST OF ALL the legend that was READ throughout was changed A BIT TO READ the world turns TO ash DOT ah hah DOT so ash IS the chosen one whatever DOT IN the japanese VERSION the inhabitants OF arshia needed A

discussing the conditions OF lugia s existence NOT that ash IS going TO make ALL the difference DOT overall IN this category ash wasn T really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped BY many along the way DOT br br A lot OF the other stuff IS kind OF nit picking DOT furura s flute song wasn T nearly AS sweet AND enjoyable AS the japanese one DOT jirarudan s speech TO them saying his collection started WITH A mew card ugh DOT even worse misty s outrage originally concerned the way moltres AND zapdos were being held DOT why didn T you put them IN pokballs WHEN you caught them this IS LIKE caging them TO be displayed DOT much different FROM whining about him thinking pokmon ARE things TO be collected LIKE stamps DOT IF there were ANY REAL redeeming VALUES IN

493,WHEN sam peckinpah s superlative the wild bunch opened the door TO outrageous displays OF graphic cinematic ultra violence it did so WITH A talented IF whisky marinated hand guiding the camera AND had A compelling story WITH CHARACTERS who had actual DEPTH but IN NO TIME flat there were scores OF imitators that fell far FROM the benchmark SET BY peckinpah s epic AND soldier blue definitely

government gold cash the cheyenne need TO buy guns WITH so IN short ORDER the soldiers ARE wiped OUT AND cresta flees TO the hills accompanied BY honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman

their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements A band OF hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played BY donald pleasance here giving one OF his most ridiculous performances AND that s saying something AND IN the tradition OF many previous western SET romantic comedies EACH other DOT br br during the course OF their misadventures the two opposites ARE inevitably AND predictably attracted TO EACH other AND eventually END up getting it ON WHILE gant has A freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg NO less IN what was surely the ONLY conveniently located cave FOR AT LEAST A twelve mile radius that wasn T filled WITH rattlesnakes mountain lions OR who knows what TO say NOTHING OF the cheyenne who could have done something really spiffy WITH such A primo apartment there i GO thinking IN nyc REAL estate terms again DOT br br realizing that their love could never flourish outside OF the cave cresta leaves gant AND makes it TO the fort BY herself ONLY TO discover that the moron IN charge won T spare A couple OF men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs ALL available personnel TO launch an attack ON the nearby cheyenne village AND once cresta gets wind OF that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby TO be AND makes A beeline straight TO the cheyenne TO warn them OF what s coming DOT br br what happens NEXT IS what gained the film its infamy it turns OUT that ALL the wacky misadventures AND squabbling were ALL just A LEAD IN TO A hideous reenactment OF the sand creek massacre an orgy OF rape torture AND GENERAL sadistic evil perpetrated IN the NAME OF keeping the country clean AND almost forty years AFTER its RELEASE this SEQUENCE still disturbs AND nauseates FOR its sheer cruelty DOT children ARE trampled beneath the hooves OF charging horses OR impaled ON bayonets unarmed people ARE beheaded A nice effect i have TO admit women ARE stripped AND pawed BY gangs OF slavering brutes THEN raped AND mutilated IN one truly sickening INSTANCE A naked native woman puts up too much OF A fight so her rapist INSTEAD decides TO cut OFF her breasts which we thankfully ONLY see the START OF BEFORE the camera moves ON TO chronicle SOME other hideous act AND scores OF innocent people ARE shot AND dismembered their compone nt parts impaled ON pikes AND waved about IN victorious celebration OR kept AS the most ghoulish OF souvenirs DOT NO joke this scene would instantly garner an nc rating IF released today TO say NOTHING OF possibly spurring native american interest GROUPS TO riot IN the streets OVER the incredibly exploitative manner IN which the atrocities ARE depicted DOT br br i M ALL IN favor OF westerns that don T shy away FROM honest portrayals OF how the west was won OR stolen IF truth be told but this film has NO idea OF what kind OF movie it wants TO be one MINUTE it s A heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment OF the natives was totally effed up well duh THEN it s A light hearted battle OF the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant IS AND manages TO look hot IN her tasty red calico poncho WITH NO undies but that ALL goes OUT the WINDOW WHEN donald pleasance shows up WITH an unintentionally hilarious pair OF buck toothed dentures AND our heroes must figure OUT how TO ESCAPE FROM his murderous clutches IN A sub plot that goes nowhere ALL OF which culminates IN the aforementioned apocalyptic climax DOT ANY one OF those tacks would have been okay FOR A coherent film but the END RESULT IS A slapdash mess that milked the horrors OF its FINAL ten minutes FOR ALL they were worth IN the film s promotion AND poster imagery DOT br br but BY trying TO be ALL things TO ALL audiences soldier blue ends up AS an incoherent preachy mulligan stew OF presumably well intentioned political correctness but IF they were going TO tell the story OF the sand creek massacre wouldn T it have been A good idea TO have SOME indian CHARACTERS who were MORE than just walk ons WITH murphy brown acting AS their mouthpiece we GET TO know absolutely NOTHING OF the people who GET wiped OUT solely FOR what appears TO be A crass ploy TO lure gorehound

659,WHEN A movie OF A book seems pointless AND incomprehensible the cause can invariably be FOUND IN the book either it was pointless TO START WITH OR the point IS one NOT easily conveyed TO film OR the movie missed the point which IS the most frequent OF these results AND the easiest TO happen especially WHEN the point IS one NOT easily DEFINED DOT the book morvern callar has A point EVERY reader OF the book must have felt this AND felt AS IF he had gotten it but i suspect most OF them could NOT STATE it IN words DOT i M NOT sure i can myself but perhaps it comes TO this OR something LIKE it things come things GO such IS life but we carry ON OR AT ANY rate SOME OF us people LIKE morvern DO DOT NO doubt A MORE erudite critic could construct A MORE adequate definition DOT but the important fact IS that there IS A point possibly the SUM OF the entire story IS the point AND that this would have been the main thing TO keep IN VIEW AND TO carry OVER IN adapting the story TO film

TEXT has been violated DOT the merit OF the book IS something i conceded grudgingly IN reading it i FOUND it A bloody nuisance AND an occasion FOR kicking the author IN the pants AND getting him IN TO finish the job properly DOT the narrative IS supposed TO be the WORK OF the half educated morvern but that illusion IS constantly dispelled BY A dozen different TYPES OF literary effect AS IF the author were poking AT her WITH his pen there ARE inconsistencies OF STYLE AND tone AS IF different sections had been composed AT different times AND ANY conclusions i could reach about morvern had TO remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended AND which he did NOT FOR INSTANCE despite morvern s own SELF characterization AS A raver am i wrong that IN the END she remains essentially A working CLASS scots girl AND beneath her wrapping OF music downloads NOT so different FROM those OF generations past IN ANY CASE despite my irritation AT the author i couldn T deny that his book stuck WITH me AND what i couldn T GET OUT OF my head was his CHARACTER s attitude her angle ON the world which was almost AS vivid AS A goya portrait DOT morvern IS the kind OF person who s ALWAYS encountering situations AT once rather comic AND rather horrible occasionally she invites them but MORE often they land ON her LIKE flies so that much OF her life consists OF A kind OF gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical AND unconsciously philosophical AND that doesn T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE it idiosyncratically enough DOT the complex OF incidents AND OF

one thing the book IS one that IF it IS TO be dramatized virtually cries OUT FOR monologues BY the main CHARACTER TO the audience WITHOUT her COMMENTS her perspective her voice the story loses most OF its meaning DOT it has lost MORE OF it IN that the adaptor has expurgated it OF its comic AND horrible elements the most memorable incidents FROM the book ARE curtailed BEFORE they turn grotty AND so morvern s responses whether OF amusement OR distaste depending ON her mood ARE missing too AND the incidents NO longer have A reason FOR being IN the story DOT IN short the filmmaker chose FOR SOME reason TO turn A brisk edgy serio comic novel INTO A genteel art tv film AND chose AS her typical image one OF ms DOT morton languishing IN A artistically shaded melancholy AS IF the outing morvern signs up FOR were A tour OF the stations OF the CROSS DOT this isn T AT ALL what the book OR the morvern OF the book was about DOT FOR another thing the morvern OF the movie isn T scottish the actress said IN an interview she hadn T had TIME TO study up the accent AND she ought TO be it s important that she her FAMILY AND her mates ARE ALL FROM A single place DOT AND finally the film IS missing the END OF the story morvern s spending ALL she has AND coming home TO icy darkness it s winter the dam has frozen the POWER has gone OUT AND the pub IS dark DOT minus this AND minus ALL OF the rest what s LEFT IS A failed art film A dead film about A subject whose strength lay precisely IN her refusal OR native inability ever TO give IN TO being dead DOT,Safe

691,lorenzo lamas stars AS SOME TYPE OF cia agent who captures SOME exotic beauty named alexa kidnaps her daughter AND forces her TO fight her former employers DOT o DOT j simpson IS ALSO ON board TO provide A dash OF acting credibility FOR the NOT so talented ensemble DOT i must admit i M NOT A fan OF lorenzo lamas OR his movies DOT he stinks DOT however WHEN compared TO o DOT j simpson AND lamas comatose wife kinmont lamas seems LIKE ah jean claude van damme DOT i ONLY saw cia because OF the renewed interest around the o DOT j simpson trial you see because IF your parents had cable AND the extra channels you couldn T ESCAPE this movie DOT IN you could GO TO an amish community AND SOME moron would have this playing IN their portable tv DOT the movie itself IS A collection OF lame ACTION SEQUENCES AND would be intrigue although the shock VALUE OF o DOT j simpson jumping AFTER fireballs AND exchanging would be one liners DO provide SOME unintentional humor DOT ALSO WHERE was bobby knight AND kobe bryant TO make this A complete camp classic br br OUT OF bad,Safe
692,jim carrey IS back TO much the same ROLE that he played IN the mask A timid guy who IS trying TO GET ahead IN the world but who seems TO be plagued WITH bad luck DOT even WHEN he tries TO help A homeless guy FROM being harassed BY A bunch OF hoodlums AND OF course they have TO be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires DOT IN that CASE it wasn T too hard TO predict that he was about TO have A handful OF angry hoodlums but i LIKE that the movie suggests that things LIKE that shouldn T be ignored DOT i M reminded OF the episode OF michael moore s brilliant the awful truth WHEN they had A man lay down ON the sidewalk AND pretend TO be dead AND see who would actually stop AND make sure he was okay DOT the results were NOT very promising so it s nice TO see someone IN the movies setting A good example DOT br br jim carrey plays the part OF bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems TO be falling apart DOT OR even better it seems TO be breaking up BY the blows OF bad luck LIKE an asteroid entering the atmosphere A little metaphor that comes up WHEN bruce miraculously finds himself A gigantic news story later IN the film DOT bruce IS nearly years OLD AND ALL he has TO SHOW FOR it IS A POSITION AS A news reporter OF the sort that reports ON such exciting news AS the LOCAL bakery that s seeking TO bake the world s biggest cookie DOT he s desperate TO obtain the job OF head anchor AT the tv station but he loses his cool ON live tv WHEN he hears that the job went TO his rival colleague DOT you have TO love how they TIME the revelation OF this news TO him seconds BEFORE his FIRST live report DOT needless TO say he loses his temper ON live tv IN one OF the funniest scenes OF the entire film DOT br br morgan freeman delivers A fantastic performance AS the man himself displaying A god whose infinite wisdom IS somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent AS an actor DOT he IS the kind OF god who takes his job very seriously but IN such A way AS TO advise his followers AS well AS the viewers OF this movie that there ARE times WHEN you need TO slow down AND DO SOME manual labor IN life DOT i love his line that SOME OF the happiest people IN the world come home smelling TO high heaven AT the END OF the DAY DOT there ARE A lot OF people IN the world maybe MORE than our SHARE IN america who ARE so absorbed BY their money AND their possessions AND their jobs AND everything that they completely lost touch WITH the NATURAL side OF themselves AS humans DOT br br one OF the biggest strengths IS that the movie IS able TO provide great advice TO people IN GENERAL about improving their lives AND this message IS clear AND acceptable regardless OF the viewer s religion DOT i FOR example tend TO reject organized religion IN ALL forms AND i see god AND satan TO be metaphors FOR different aspects OF nature AND human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived OR CONTINUE TO live DOT but despite the fact that i don T believe that god EXISTS AS an entity overseeing the universe OR AS A janitor dressed ALL IN white who mops the floors OF his downtown office IN his spare TIME i was able TO appreciate the messages that were delivered IN this movie DOT br br jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that TIES them ALL together AND makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come DOT IF you compare bruce almighty WITH movies LIKE ace ventura BOTH OF which i loved BY the way OR A lot OF what he did BEFORE he got INTO film it s amazing how far he s come DOT he has moved FROM cheesy tv comedy TO cheesy comedic films TO comedies that ARE truly intelligent AND meaningful LIKE this film AS well AS OTHERS LIKE the truman SHOW man ON the moon AND the majestic easily one OF his GREATEST films ever DOT jim carrey has unmistakably moved FROM the cheesy comedy OF his past TO become one OF the most important comic actors working today DOT br br jennifer aniston ALSO once again provides an excellent addition TO the movie AS she did IN the side splitting office SPACE AS bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated BY bruce s growing stress about his life AS well AS his negligence TO ask her TO marry him DOT there IS definitely SOME low brow comedy IN the film that doesn T really fit WITH the importance OF the film s meaning OR the quality OF the delivery such AS the dog reading the newspaper ON the toilet AND the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice TO see ace ventura s friend spike make A cameo appearance DOT AS stephen king very well knows it s ALWAYS nice TO see familiar CHARACTERS DOT it s almost LIKE seeing FAMILY again DOT br br bruce IS endowed WITH the powers OF god FOR A given PERIOD OF TIME so that he can understand life A BIT better AND he says A lot about himself WHEN he uses the powers ONLY FOR his own purposes rather than TO help ALL OF the people who pray TO him DOT the thing i love about this IS that LIKE i said BEFORE religion IS ABSENT FROM my life but i was able TO watch this AND learn A lot about myself AS well BY thinking about what kinds OF things i would have done had i been endowed WITH such powers DOT the movie allows us TO learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even MORE DOT br br the scenes that involve the news station ARE easily the funniest IN the entire film such AS the scene WHEN bruce loses his temper about the anchor POSITION the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried WITH an original birth certificate AND A complete SET OF dental records the scene WHERE bruce s rival colleague IS made TO GO nuts ON camera AND my favorites the ones AT the beginning AND the END involving the LOCAL bakery s cooking DOT the movie has plenty OF TIME FOR carrey TO deliver SOME excellent jokes such AS WHEN he says TO god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be REAL bashes AND TO be careful about drinking because ON OF him might need A ride home i ALSO loved the END WHEN he says that behind EVERY great man IS A woman rolling her eyes DOT A little too TRUE AND AS gallagher would ADD behind EVERY great man IS ALSO an amazed mother IN law DOT br br bruce almighty IS one OF the MORE memorable comedies TO have come OUT FOR quite A WHILE AND IS probably the ONLY directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious TO buy ON dvd TO ADD TO my personal collection DOT it IS A comedy written AND performed IN good taste but WITH enough relatively low brow humor TO keep the kids entertained DOT this IS A meaningful comedy FOR the whole FAMILY which IS becoming rarer AND rarer these days DOT IN A world that IS about TO be flogged WITH yet another american pie film AND another scary movie which ARE ONLY scary because OF their sheer barbarous idiocy it s nice TO see that there ARE still people making comedies worth watching DOT don T miss this one DOT,Safe
693,spoiler alert IN this generic AND forgettable ACTION movie lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy pretty boy act AND his future REAL life ex kathleen kinmont IS ass kicking hot chick alexa DOT oj simpson IS A detective coasting BY ON his since vanished genial PUBLIC persona DOT TRANSLATION cable tv filler DOT there isn T enough skin TO qualify this AS A guilty pleasure DOT br br the script has SOME gaping holes DOT best worst moment IN one jarring scene oj s partner expresses his aversion TO the morgue DOT oj responds that SOME OF the bodies ARE pretty hot OR words TO that effect DOT this vague necrophilia reference IS offensive enough but IN light OF the murders COMMITTED shortly AFTER this movie was released it IS truly appalling AND therefore entertaining IN an unintentional horrible way DOT i was so startled that i laughed UNTIL champagne came OUT OF my nose DOT now that s A guilty pleasure DOT bc,Safe

695,AS an impressionable YEAR OLD i liked the love conquers ALL philosophy OF the s sitcom bridget loves bernie DOT i did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications BETWEEN A jewish cab driver david birney AND an irish catholic school teacher meredith baxter AND BOTH SETS OF parents harold j DOT stone AND bibi osterwald AS bernie s parents audra lindley AND david doyle AS bridget s parents who have issues WITH the young couple s interfaith marriage DOT br br looking AT the SHOW now WITH years OF personal life experiences i am amazed that the SHOW was even A success FOR one albeit highly rated season DOT created BY veteran tv writer bernard slade who A few years AFTER the SHOW s cancellation would WRITE the successful play same TIME NEXT YEAR bridget loves bernie was A very light superficial comedy that collapsed UNDER its own airy weight DOT br br there was NO denying the REAL life chemistry BETWEEN birney AND baxter DOT but IN later years BOTH actors have shown that they ARE better actors IN other projects birney IN his short lived ROLE IN st DOT elsewhere AND baxter IN FAMILY AND FAMILY TIES DOT here they were trying TO breathe life IN A SHOW that needed A much gritter comic edge which might have given the complications MORE DEPTH TO A very controversial subject DOT br br the SHOW aired saturday nights BETWEEN two cbs powerhouses ALL IN the FAMILY AND mary tyler moore DOT BOTH OF those shows were smart funny AND had enough OF an edge MORE so ON the former that the latter that kept my interest IN the situation AND the CHARACTERS DOT bridget loves bernie was NOT very smart AND ONLY had SOME occasional chuckles DOT br br this was another example OF A SHOW that really was NOT AS good AS i remembered DOT,Safe
696,china o brien was an attempt TO make cynthia rothrock A star IN the united states DOT this golden harvet production was helmed BY veteran director robert clouse DOT sadly he was either lucky WITH enter the dragon OR he s lost his touch because he s NOT that great OF A director DOT the ONLY reason TO watch this movie IS TO see the fighting skills OF ms DOT rothrock AND richard norton DOT IF this movie was directed BY corey yuen OR hoi meng it could have been an ACTION classic INSTEAD OF A cheesy straight TO video ACTION flick DOT br br china o brien RETURNS home TO help OUT her dad DOT he s HAVING trouble WITH the LOCAL mob AND he needs her help DOT so she RETURNS home AND restores ORDER WITH the help OF two unlikely people DOT but will they be enough TO topple mister big AND his evil cronies br br IF you re A big cynthia rothrock fan THEN this movie s catered FOR you DOT i ONLY enjoyed the fighting scenes everything ELSE IS rubbish DOT why didn T raymond chow shell OUT A few shekels AND hired A top notch ACTION director br br recommended DOT,Safe
697,this film was hard TO GET A HOLD OF AND WHEN i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming DOT i mean this IS one OF the great stories OF the twentieth century an UNKNOWN man takes advantage OF the unsuspecting airline industry AND gets away WITH millions IN ransom WITHOUT hurting anyone OR bungling the attempt DOT WITH ALL OF this built IN interest how could anyone make such A lackluster talk laden flick OF this TRUE life EVENT DOT WHILE williams IS ALWAYS interesting the screenwriters assumed that the d DOT b DOT cooper persona was stereotypically heroic LIKE A movie star s what we GET IS A TYPE WITHOUT ANY engaging details OR insights INTO the mind OF A person daring enough AND clever enough TO have pulled it OFF DOT harrold practically steals the movie WITH her spunk AND pure beauty but the REAL letdown was IN the handling OF the plot AND the lame direction DOT shame ON this film FOR even existing DOT,Safe
698,this one AND her pilgrim soul ARE two OF my favorite episodes IN this NEW VERSION OF twilight ZONE DOT AS i mentioned IN my COMMENT ON the NEW series there s something lacking IN this NEW series DOT maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has TO be learned DOT it s A little BIT MORE mawkish AND sentimental than serling s VERSION DOT however this episode can be considered AS quite sentimental too DOT i think the appeal IS that NO matter what they DO the lovers can never unite DOT i remember i wasn T surprised BY the korean movie il mare later remade INTO the lake house DOT i think it s because i saw this episode FIRST so it ruined the impact OF the later film DOT,Safe
699,AS someone who likes chase scenes AND was really intrigued BY this fascinating TRUE life tale i was optimistic heading INTO this film but too many obstacles got INTO the way OF the good story it should have been DOT br br the bad i M A fan OF robert duvall AND many OF the CHARACTERS he has played but his ROLE here IS A dull one AS an insurance investigator DOT br br the dialog IS insipid AND the pretty kathryn harrold IS REAL garbage mouth DOT FROM what i READ there were several directors replacing EACH other ON this film AND that s too bad DOT you can tell things aren T RIGHT WITH the story DOT i couldn T GET involved WITH TREAT williams portrayal OF cooper either DOT he should have been fascinating but he wasn T IN this movie DOT it s ALSO kind OF A sad COMMENT that A guy committing A crime IS SOME sort OF folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting FOR the guy too DOT br br NOT everything was disappointing DOT i can T complain about the scenery FROM the lush green forests OF oregon TO the desert IN arizona DOT br br i d LIKE TO see this movie re made AND done better because it IS A one OF A kind story DOT,Safe
