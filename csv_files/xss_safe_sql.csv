5,this film lacked something i couldn T put my finger ON AT FIRST charisma ON the part OF the LEADING actress DOT this inevitably translated TO lack OF chemistry WHEN she shared the screen WITH her LEADING man DOT even the romantic scenes came across AS being merely the actors AT play DOT it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed FROM the actors DOT i just don T know DOT br br but could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef IN love WITH he seemed MORE enamored OF his culinary skills AND restaurant AND ultimately OF himself AND his youthful exploits than OF anybody OR anything ELSE DOT he never convinced me he was IN love WITH the princess DOT br br i was disappointed IN this movie DOT but don T forget it was nominated FOR an oscar so judge FOR yourself DOT,safe

27,this film IS about A male escort getting involved IN A murder investigation that happened IN the circle OF powerful men s wives DOT br br i thought the walker would be thrilling AND engaging but i was so wrong DOT the pacing IS painfully AND excruciatingly slow that even AFTER minutes OF the film NOTHING happens much DOT seriously the FIRST HOUR could be condensed INTO ten minutes DOT that s how slow it IS DOT br br the fact that it lacks ANY thrills OR ACTION scenes aggravates the boredom DOT it s almost shocking that even argument scenes ARE so plain AND devoid OF emotion DOT maybe it IS because OF the stiff UPPER lip OF the higher social CLASS br br it s sad that the walker becomes such A boring mess despite such A strong CAST DOT blame it ON the poor plot AND even worse pacing DOT,safe

30,LIKE one OF the previous commenters said this had the foundations OF A great movie but something happened ON the way TO delivery DOT such A waste because collette s performance was eerie AND williams was believable DOT i just kept waiting FOR it TO GET better DOT i don T think it was bad editing OR needed another director it could have just been the film DOT it came across AS A canadian movie something LIKE the FIRST few seasons OF x files DOT NOT cheap just hokey DOT ALSO it needed A little MORE suspense DOT something that makes you jump OFF your seat DOT the movie reached that moment THEN faded away kind OF LIKE A FALSE climax DOT i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away FROM the reality OF the story but i thought that part was reached WHEN gabriel was IN the hospital looking FOR the boy DOT this movie needs TO have A director s cut that tries TO fix these problems DOT,safe
31,A worn OUT plot OF A man who takes the rap FOR A woman IN A murder CASE the equally worn OUT plot OF an outsider ON the inside who eventually IS shut OUT DOT br br WITH such an outstanding CASE one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins DOT but scene AFTER scene drones BY WITH NO change IN intensity NO CHARACTER arcs AND inexplicable behavior DOT br br the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary OR ON the other hand completely unexplored DOT it seemed TO be included ONLY TO titillate the viewers DOT WHEN will hollywood learn that HAVING gay CHARACTERS does NOT automatically make A MORE compelling picture br br A regrettably dreadful movie DOT WHEN will lauren bacall pick A good one i expected better OF her AND kristin scott thomas DOT this one IS definitely one TO miss DOT,safe
32,the night listener held my attention WITH robin williams shining AS A NEW york city radio host who becomes enamored WITH his friendship WITH A YEAR OLD boy rory culkin who IS very ill DOT williams has never met the boy IN person AS they have ONLY been IN contact BY talking ON the telephone DOT however williams ex boyfriend nice job FROM bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams TO arrange A meeting WITH him IN person DOT what follows makes A permanent impact ON williams IN A way he does NOT expect DOT i will LEAVE it AT that DOT toni collette ALSO stars DOT br br i enjoyed this film WITH toni collette giving A memorable portrayal OF culkin s adoptive mother DOT sandra oh ALSO starred AS williams friend DOT the night listener IS inspired BY actual events AND it has A somber almost creepy silence throughout DOT AT times it IS predictable NO thanks TO SOME OF the reviews i READ BEFORE seeing the movie AND just due TO logic but i liked it anyway DOT i enjoy williams IN roles LIKE this MORE so than his comedic CHARACTERS so that was an added bonus FOR me DOT recommended DOT,safe

36,IF there IS one thing TO recommend about this film IS that it IS intriguing DOT the premise certainly draws the audience IN because it IS A mystery AND throughout the film there ARE hints that there IS something dark lurking about DOT however there IS NOT much tension AND williams mild mannered portrayal doesn T DO much TO makes us relate TO his obsession WITH the boy DOT br br collete fares much better AS the woman whose TRUE nature AND intentions ARE NOT very clear DOT the production felt rushed AND holes ARE apparent DOT it certainly feels LIKE A preview FOR A much MORE complete AND better effort DOT the book IS probably better DOT br br one thing IS certain taupin must have written something truly good TO have inspired AT LEAST one commendable effort DOT,safe

80,titanic IS A LONG but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage ON the unsinkable ship DOT writer director james cameron has done A great job OF making this movie about A fictional love story BETWEEN two very different people AND combining that WITH the REAL EVENT OF the titanic that sunk AFTER hitting an iceberg ON april claiming thousands OF lives who perished IN the icy freeing waters OF the north atlantic DOT the two leads IN the film ARE great IN their roles INCLUDING leonardo dicaprio AND kate winslet DOT they make FOR A good ON screen couple DOT dicpario AND winslet ALSO had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms BETWEEN them that much MORE believable DOT they BOTH showed REAL talent WHEN this one came OUT AND BOTH OF them have continued TO SHOW just that IN their most recently films AS well DOT the rest OF the supporting CAST INCLUDING billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde AND bill paxton IN A small ROLE ARE equally impressive AS their CHARACTERS who help bring them TO life IN this film DOT the love story the ACTION suspense AND the special effects ARE magnificent done especially FOR that TIME DOT the horror OF the situation the CHARACTERS were IN felt so REAL because it really happened making you want most OF them TO survive this life AND death situation DOT the pacing was A little slow AT times AND it was A little LONG but the rest OF the movie made up FOR it s few flaws DOT titanic makes FOR A great DATE movie which IS sure TO make SOME girls cry almost EVERY TIME they watch it DOT the fact that this really happened definitely added TO the movie making you feel sorry FOR ALL the lives lost WHEN the titanic sunk INTO the atlantic AFTER hitting an iceberg DOT overall titanic IS A tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall IN love WHILE ON the ill fated ship thats brought TO life BY the exceptional performances FROM the CAST especially dicaprio AND winslet who definitely make this movie worth the TIME TO watch DOT,safe

85,the film lacks STYLE i mean original STYLE DOT everything looks copied INCLUDING ACTION FIRST appearances IN the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc DOT YES there the goof ups were original LIKE IN the beginning A car IS shown WITH NUMBER up NUMBER AND few seconds later it starts falling down A hill WITH NUMBER mh DOT that was one IN many goof ups OF the movie anything good IN the movie YES FOR kareena fans IF there ARE ANY kareena IN bikini DOT FOR akshay fans his dialogs AND ACTION stunts DOT thats it DOT NOTHING ELSE DOT so watch it ON your own risk AND don T blame the director OR actors DOT director IS already insane AND actors i pity them DOT,safe

90,FOR me personally this film goes down IN my top four OF ALL TIME DOT NO exceptions DOT james cameron has proved himself TIME AND TIME again that he IS A master storyteller DOT through films such AS aliens the abyss AND BOTH terminators it IS clear that he was A brilliant AND confidant director AS far AS ACTION AND science fiction goes DOT he sees A story AND adds A strange quality TO the film DOT but titanic IS so much different TO his other strokes OF brilliance DOT the film IS exceptionally moving AND allows room FOR surprises plot development AND interesting CHARACTER developments IN A story that everyone knows DOT the story OF the famed voyager sinking ON her maiden voyage IS legend so the challenge was FOR cameron TO make A truthful interesting AND entertaining film about it DOT the acting IS wonderful AS leonardo dicaprio who plays jack AND kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight WITH the RELEASE OF this film AND IN most films i GET annoyed WHEN the supporting CHARACTERS aren T given A lot TO DO but IN this film it IS MORE purposeful because AS an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it IS quickly apparent that it IS rose s AND jack s story alone NO one ELSE DOT emotionally it IS entirely satisfying AND can LEAVE NO dry eye IN A theater OR home DOT the music has become iconic AND legendary DOT it IS composer james horner s finest soundtrack ever AND evokes so much FROM the film AND the audience DOT the song AFTER so LONG has become annoying but i still appreciate it FOR the phenomenon it IS AND this film IS DOT ONLY one problem the usual james cameron problem IS the dialogue which IS memorable but IN A bad way AS IN how cheesy it IS AT points but ALL that aside DOT james cameron has delivered A masterpiece AND A romantic epic that sweeps you away ON A journey OF A lifetime DOT my heart won T GO ON FROM this one DOT,safe

98,titanic directed BY james cameron presents A fictional love story ON the historical setting OF the titanic DOT the plot IS SIMPLE noncomplicated OR NOT FOR those who love plots that twist AND turn AND keep you IN suspense DOT the END OF the movie can be figured OUT WITHIN minutes OF the START OF the film but the love story IS an interesting one however DOT kate winslett IS wonderful AS rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed BY cal billy zane DOT early ON the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio A LOWER CLASS artist ON his way TO america AFTER winning his ticket aboard titanic IN A poker game DOT IF he wants something he goes AND gets it unlike the UPPER CLASS who ARE so concerned WITH their social worries DOT the two fall IN love AND the audience sees the sinking OF the titanic primarily through their eyes DOT br br the movie begins IN modern times WITH the exploration OF the wreck BY A GROUP searching FOR treasures that sunk WITH the titanic which has recently occurred DOT one OF the survivors OF the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard OF the exploration OF the wreck ON television AND IS flown TO the boat WHERE the SEARCH IS being led FROM TO tell OF what she remembers TO help the SEARCH DOT she gets TO telling her memory OF the one AND ONLY voyage OF the titanic DOT WITH this the scene shifts TO southhampton ireland WHERE the titanic SET sail FROM ON april AS ALL the passengers ARE boarding DOT AFTER another stop ON the irish coast titanic went OUT TO see ON its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound FOR NEW york DOT historically the FIRST few days OF the voyage went BY uneventful but the fictional plot OF the story IS developed during this TIME AS rose sees the hopeless entrapement OF an engagement that she IS IN TO the wealthy cal hockley AND falls IN love WITH third CLASS passenger jack dawson DOT captain smith alledgedly AS shown IN the movie was urged BY the white star line director TO increase the speed OF the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines AND receive extra publicity BY arriving IN NEW york ON thursday night AND NOT ON friday morning AS planned DOT smith THEN ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years OF experience TO stretch the titanic s legs OUT TO FULL speed DOT the titanic had reports that the waters IN the atlantic they were sailing IN were FULL OF icebergs but they ignored these warnings AND proceeded AT FULL speed AS shown IN the movie DOT ON april AT an iceberg was sighted DOT they attempted TO shut OFF the engines AND turn the ship OUT OF the PATH OF the iceberg but there was NOT enough TIME AND the ship hit the iceberg ON the starboard side AS depicted IN the film DOT the portrayal OF the many small holes IN the side OF the ship AND NOT one LARGE gash along the side IS accurate DOT the crew OF titanic sent OUT distress calls AND SET OFF distress rockets AS shown UNTIL WHEN the lights finally failed DOT the lights OF the california were spotted six miles away but they failed TO realize what was going ON AND did NOT respond TO titanic s many pleas FOR help DOT the california had tried earlier IN the DAY TO warn titanic OF the severe ice that had caused them TO stop their trip but titanic had brushed them OFF causing the california TO turn OFF its radio AND LEAVE the titanic ON its own DOT the FIRST CLASS women AND children were the FIRST AS depicted TO be put INTO the twenty lifeboats that were ON the ship DOT overwhelmingly the third CLASS passengers suffered the most amount OF deaths OF ANY CLASS AND the crew was hit hard IN this tragedy too DOT the word OF white star line employees AND FIRST CLASS passengers was believed OVER that OF SECOND AND third CLASS passengers WHEN authorities were trying TO gain information OF the sinking DOT ALSO the metal that was used TO build the titanic has been FOUND IN recent years UNDER conditions OF severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank TO be extremely brittle DOT overall the basic plot IS very accurate IN its portayal OF the events AND the times AT which these events took place ON the titanic DOT br br many OF the CHARACTERS IN the story were NOT REAL AND created simply FOR the purpose OF the movie OR AS composite CHARACTERS TO represent possible CHARACTERISTICS AND ideas OF people ON the ship DOT the core GROUP OF rose jack cal AND rose s mother ALL were fictional CHARACTERS added INTO the story AS they represent different GROUPS OF people FROM the TIME DOT yet many CHARACTERS such AS the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay AND ALL OF the titanic s officers were REAL DOT the maiden voyage was going TO be captain edward smith s LAST voyage anyway AS he planned TO retire afterwards DOT he had been A part OF the white star line since WHERE he worked his way up TO his status AS the millionaire s captain WHEN the titanic sunk DOT the portrayals OF the officers IS accurate AS ONLY four survived the tragedy EXCEPT FOR the officer who threatened TO kill ALL OF the passengers OF the ship WITH his pistol DOT he IS ON record AS acting heroicly AND was misportrayed TO the point that james cameron apologized AND evoked A monument IN his honor IN the officer s former canadian hometown DOT AS shown IN the movie there was A LANGUAGE problem BETWEEN the crew AND many OF the LOWER CLASS passengers FROM non english speaking nations DOT IN addition officer lowe was the ONLY officer who came back IN the lifeboat AS depicted DOT the OLD people shown IN their bed AS the water came IN their room were based ON the strauss DOT NOT wanting TO LEAVE her husband s side mrs DOT strauss refused TO GET IN her lifeboat AND died WITH her husband ON the titanic DOT furthermore mr DOT goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy AND smoking A cigar reportedly did GO OUT LIKE this dressed IN his best DOT the richest man ON the ship john jacob astor who OWNED most OF manhattan died nonetheless AS well but his much younger wife was saved IN A lifeboat DOT IN addition molly brown was saved AND later had medals made up FOR the crew OF the carpethia that picked the survivors OF titanic up FROM the water DOT her ticket ON the titanic had COST OVER four thousand dollars AND BY the END OF her life she ended up broke DOT ALL OF the interiors OF the ship were masterfully replacated down TO the LAST pieces OF china AND silverware DOT the gymnasium which IS hardly seen IS recreated perfectly WITH ALL OF the machines reproduced TO MATCH those seen IN OLD photographs DOT the wonderful outfits AND costuming were an excellent re creation OF the post victorian era OF DOT the rich AT this TIME practically ruled everything AS the women s suffrage movement had NOT quite gotten moving yet DOT women during this TIME often married FOR financial SECURITY AS rose was considering doing AND normally took A back seast status TO their husbands AS cal wished FOR rose TO DO DOT the rich did NOT take well TO NEW money such AS molly brown AS depicted DOT everything OF the TIME was very formal DOT women had TO be escorted TO dinner BY A male figure AS seen WITH IN the dining scenes DOT smoking was NOT very common among women OF the TIME but holders OF cigarettes which were just coming IN AT the TIME were used AS seen WITH rose IN the movie DOT men OF the TIME generally smoked cigars NOT cigarettes DOT women were constained physically BY their corsets AND socially BY society DOT although james cameron had NO background IN historical films he brought IN experts OF titanic coupled WITH two years spent CROSS REFERENCING the history OF the titanic AND few liberties were taken DOT the beautiful cinematography AND special effects ALSO helped TO make the film even MORE breathtaking DOT br br A recognizable message can be seen IN the movie titanic AS the people ON the ship had about three hours TO contemplate their demise DOT the director james cameron shows the various reactions TO this TIME OF crisis IN people s lives DOT everyone reacts differently AND he gets you TO think OF how you might have reacted had you been IN that situation ON the titanic ON that fateful night DOT IN addition this film IS A reflection OF the s WHEN it was produced AS it gives A look INTO the wreck OF the titanic DOT ONLY IN the past fifteen years has the site OF the actual titanic been FOUND AND explored DOT this movie was able TO give us A deeper look INTO A disaster that many would NOT have viewed DOT however the moral question OF whether people today should be taking treasures FROM the wreck OF an underwater graveyard IS posed DOT there have been attempts TO stop treasure seeking missions such AS the one portrayed IN titanic but ALL have failed DOT AS it stands today anyone can make A voyage TO the titanic AND take whatever valuables they AS portrayed IN the film showing the GENERAL VALUES OF our TIME ON this matter DOT br br technically the film IS very well done DOT TO GET footage OF the wreck AT the bottom OF the ocean it took twelve dives TO GET ALL OF the footage needed FOR the movie DOT IN addition A special camera had TO be created TO withstand the intense pressure AT the bottom OF the ocean DOT cameron did NOT plan ON USING the probe TO GO AS far inside titanic AS anyone has IN the years since the ship sunk but it worked OUT that this provided an UNIQUE perspective INTO the ship DOT furthermore throughout the film fade ins AND outs FROM the wreck OF titanic TO the scene OF titanic during its actual voyage DOT this shift BETWEEN the modern scene TO the past scene during the voyage works AS an excellent transition that makes the story easy TO follow IN aclear manner DOT AT the very beginning OF the movie A septune recreation IS used TO recreate the scene WHEN the actual people LEFT the european coast ON titanic giving it distinction FROM the rest OF the events OF the film DOT br br titanic plays almost LIKE A historical biography AND IS LIKE A WORK OF art A TRUE epic DOT LIKE most history novels we know the ending but it doesn T take away FROM the wonderful treats that can be FOUND IN this picture DOT certain aspects OF this film ARE academy award material INCLUDING costuming sound cintematography AND editing DOT IF you LIKE interesting CHARACTERS that will give you an insight INTO the life OF CHARACTERS IN the early s AND how they face disaster THEN this movie definitely IS FOR you DOT br br,safe
99,this IS the biggest flop OF DOT i don know what director has IS his mind OF creating such A big disaster DOT the songs have been added WITHOUT situations the story have been stretched TO fill the hrs gap AND most disgusting ARE the ACTION stunts performed BY the actors it s LIKE everyone ARE HAVING superpowers they can run IN BETWEEN the bullets ARE fire AND NOTHING happens TO them AND one person fighting WITH people DOT ONLY the best performance was BY anil kapoor man he IS ALL TIME AT his best playing the ROLE OF villain WITH A comic act speaking hinglish DOT DOT DOT akki IS ALSO done A good job DOT DOT DOT DOT but the movieee just forget it DOT,safe

127,superman ii the richard donner cut should be A fan s dream come TRUE DOT AT LONG LAST footage ONLY seen IN photos AND scenes that ONLY existed ON the printed page would finally come TO life DOT A director that was unable TO complete his vision would have the opportunity TO have his vision restored DOT it seems LIKE A winning situation DOT AND THEN you START watching this assembly OF footage AND you realize this esoteric dream IS A very REAL nightmare OF sloppiness AND incompetence DOT WHILE it s entirely possible that NO movie could compete WITH the finished perfect VERSION EACH OF us has imagined OVER the years it really should have been A thrill TO finally see this project DOT AND it IS ONLY A very few times DOT br br you know things ARE shaky WHEN the very FIRST BIT OF TEXT ON screen looks LIKE home brew computer graphics DOT but THEN we START seeing NEW footage alternates FROM superman the movie FOR the trial AND that FIRST BIT OF hesitation fades away DOT hey this IS pretty neat things ARE alright FOR these few fleeting moments UNTIL we see footage FROM stm intermixed WITH NEW effects FOR this project AND it doesn T convince AT ALL DOT AND FROM this point ON it never ever lets up DOT it s probably NOT RIGHT TO judge A movie because OF bad visual effects but WHEN this IS supposedly the direct follow up TO A movie whose tag line was you ll believe A man can fly it s difficult TO believe anything shown ON screen here DOT the best effects IN this ARE FROM the original productions DOT br br another issue WITH this re cut DOT A lot OF it just doesn T make sense DOT the ONLY reason ANY OF it really works IS because we ve ALL seen the theatrical VERSION OF superman ii A movie that does make sense DOT lester s superman ii fills IN the holes OF this assembly DOT part OF this could be because donner didn T GET TO complete shooting the other part could be because the makers OF this project were intent ON USING AS little lester material AS possible DOT what we END up WITH IS an assembly OF footage that makes superman iv look airtight AND coherent DOT br br AFTER viewing this one gets the sense that WHILE lester was faithful AND comfortable USING donner material michael thau AND his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed BY lester DOT the best scenes IN the donner cut ARE the ones lifted relatively intact FROM the released VERSION OF superman ii DOT that includes the moon SEQUENCE AND the diner SEQUENCE NOT ironically BOTH were filmed BY donner DOT but anything ELSE FROM that movie filmed BY lester IS re edited IN such A hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem LIKE A ham fisted know NOTHING DOT WHILE lester honored the donner material lester here IS thrown UNDER the bus DOT br br so IS there anything good IN this RELEASE well marlon brando IS IN it AND that s neat TO see DOT IN fact watching ANY OF the material shot BY donner IS neat since it was ALL filmed AT the same TIME AS superman the movie DOT but that ONLY highlights the problems OF this RELEASE DOT ANY OF the major scenes really just lois jumping AND scenes WITH marlon brando would have been better served AS completed scenes IN A deleted scenes SECTION DOT INSTEAD they ARE shoe horned INTO A nonsensical narrative WITH inferior performances many alternate takes FROM familiar scenes ARE used sloppy edits AND bad decisions DOT br br watch the opening scene AT the daily planet DOT why ARE we looking AT jackie cooper s back AS he calls FOR lois AND clark AT the END why DO we have lois walking INTO her dark apartment ONLY TO have that followed BY jackie cooper walking INTO A dark bathroom turning the lights ON i was INITIALLY confused BY this because i expected TO see lois DOT the entire assembly IS filled WITH questionable choices LIKE this DOT br br battle scenes ARE A mess too WITH NO geography BETWEEN cuts DOT it s just random ACTION DOT OF course the major ACTION scenes were shot BY lester AND his material IS ONLY used AS A bridge TO the NEXT SET OF donner outtakes OR alternates DOT they should have used MORE OF lester s footage but probably had too much pride TO admit that DOT br br the sloppiness extends TO the military missile AS well DOT AS noted elsewhere the missile shown IN the donner cut bears the designation xk WHILE we ALL know it s the xk A blind man IN stm knows that the producers OF this assembly who tried so hard TO honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes IN AND that mistake IS indicative OF the quality OF the entire production DOT FOR ALL the supposed care that was put INTO this the FINAL product has an air OF shoddiness TO it that IS inescapable DOT br br the entire affair would probably be easier TO digest IF warner s didn T make this A separate RELEASE here IN the states DOT AS it IS we re expected TO pay FOR what IS essentially A bonus disc OF deleted scenes WITH A play ALL OPTION DOT it s really ONLY worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but AFTER that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet FOR dust AND little ELSE DOT i know AFTER my experience OF watching this i had NEW RESPECT FOR lester s VERSION DOT it s BY NO means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were IN the script that stand OUT here IN bold relief DOT he managed TO make A movie that has entertained FOR many years AND will CONTINUE TO DO so WHILE this NEW re cut will most likely ONLY be remembered AS A footnote IN that films history DOT,safe

149,i figured that it s about TIME i let this one OUT DOT pokmon fans ARE suffering IN america these days DOT why because we rely ON kids wb AND kids entertainment TO provide us WITH our beloved series AND movies DOT AS far AS the series goes they DO A pretty good job IN bringing the fun AND magic OF the japanese versions TO television DOT so what IS their problem WHEN it comes TO the movies honestly now i have seen ALL three pokmon movies IN japanese AND i will definitely be seeing the fourth one DOT they ARE excellent movies DOT they ARE ALL enjoyable AND fun TO watch DOT AND AFTER seeing pokmon IN theaters i can T help but wonder how these american producers READ the japanese scripts DOT the way it appears it seems that they READ AND see something that says INSERT EMPTY moral here IN big bold faced letters DOT it definitely appears that way AS they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used ON msb extreme sarcasm there AND created this crap DOT br br possible spoilers FROM here ON br br well i guess i should FIRST talk about pikachu s rescue adventure DOT my FIRST gripe WITH this came WITH NO narration DOT i guess they got enough bad COMMENTS ON the pokdex narration that plagued pikachu s vacation AND INSTEAD OF going WITH A caring gentle woman s voice AS appeared IN pikachu NO natsu yasumi AND pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration ALL together DOT this wouldn T have been A problem EXCEPT FOR one thing DOT did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn T let togepi GO UNTIL the END possibly the fans but i M sure NOT the parents DOT THEN there s the theme song DOT i couldn T help but roll my eyes AT this one DOT the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou AND was sung BY japanese children DOT it was fun AND enjoyable DOT this one nauseating DOT now one OF my favorite parts OF the short was the dancing kireihana DOT nice music fun TO watch DOT that s changed WITH the bellossom DOT the music sucked FOR one but ON top OF that they had ALL the pokmon talk during the music which turned OUT TO be jumpy annoying AND just unnecessary DOT oh AND THEN there s the poliwhirl who thinks he s A poliwrath DOT you d think that guys that WORK WITH these CHARACTERS constantly would AT LEAST learn what they ARE DOT basically NOT much could save this little ill fated dub which IS very unfortunate considering its potential DOT but i haven T touched ON the worst OF it yet DOT br br you d think that the warning signs would ve been apparent TO me WHEN i received my issue OF nintendo POWER DOT FOR SOME unfathomable reason i had been PLACING SOME faith IN kids AND the wb DOT my thoughts were well they screwed up ON the FIRST movie but the SECOND IS different AS far AS the theme goes so they should DO well DOT that IN mind i just didn T pay attention TO the warning signs i encountered IN the theaters WHEN the trailers said you will believe that one person can make ALL the difference DOT WITH the way they said that AT EVERY turn i was hoping that this would NOT turn INTO A moral fest LIKE msb did AT the END OF the english VERSION DOT THEN comes nintendo POWER IN which i see ALL my fears realized IN the words the main feature the POWER OF one DOT AT that point i became A BIT MORE uneasy DOT the POWER OF one NOT A good sign DOT however i still kept SOME OF my FALSE faith DOT big mistake DOT br br sitting IN the theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved IN japanese being turned INTO complete AND utter junk DOT i hear COMMENTS that say it was better because the moral was MORE subtle DOT i can see A point IN that since they didn T pander this thing repeating it OVER AND OVER LIKE IN msb DOT however it did MORE damage than anything ELSE IN this movie DOT FIRST OF ALL the legend that was READ throughout was changed A BIT TO READ the world turns TO ash DOT ah hah DOT so ash IS the chosen one whatever DOT IN the japanese VERSION the inhabitants OF arshia needed A pokmon trainer TO carry OUT their traditional ceremony DOT this TIME he s the chosen one DOT A greater way that this did damage was TO lugia DOT lugia was one OF the coolest CHARACTERS IN A pokmon movie DOT DOT DOT DOT WHEN the movie was about lugia DOT IN this one lugia IS forced TO take A back seat TO ash DOT IN the scene WHERE they re flying back TO the main island lugia AND ash ARE discussing the conditions OF lugia s existence NOT that ash IS going TO make ALL the difference DOT overall IN this category ash wasn T really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped BY many along the way DOT br br A lot OF the other stuff IS kind OF nit picking DOT furura s flute song wasn T nearly AS sweet AND enjoyable AS the japanese one DOT jirarudan s speech TO them saying his collection started WITH A mew card ugh DOT even worse misty s outrage originally concerned the way moltres AND zapdos were being held DOT why didn T you put them IN pokballs WHEN you caught them this IS LIKE caging them TO be displayed DOT much different FROM whining about him thinking pokmon ARE things TO be collected LIKE stamps DOT IF there were ANY REAL redeeming VALUES IN this they came FROM team rocket DOT SOME pretty funny lines DOT NOT really TO make me laugh OUT loud but MORE TO make me giggle AND slightly ease the pains IN my stomach DOT well that was officially the LAST american pokmon movie i M going TO see DOT i ve imported the third one AND find it very enjoyable DOT i would rather NOT see another japanese movie be ruined IN the same fashion AS the FIRST
