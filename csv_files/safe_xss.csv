90,FOR me personally this film goes down IN my top four OF ALL TIME DOT NO exceptions DOT james cameron has proved himself TIME AND TIME again that he IS A master storyteller DOT through films such AS aliens the abyss AND BOTH terminators it IS clear that he was A brilliant AND confidant director AS far AS ACTION AND science fiction goes DOT he sees A story AND adds A strange quality TO the film DOT but titanic IS so much different TO his other strokes OF brilliance DOT the film IS exceptionally moving AND allows room FOR surprises plot development AND interesting CHARACTER developments IN A story that everyone knows DOT the story OF the famed voyager sinking ON her maiden voyage IS legend so the challenge was FOR cameron TO make A truthful interesting AND entertaining film about it DOT the acting IS wonderful AS leonardo dicaprio who plays jack AND kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight WITH the RELEASE OF this film AND IN most films i GET annoyed WHEN the supporting CHARACTERS aren T given A lot TO DO but IN this film it IS MORE purposeful because AS an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it IS quickly apparent that it IS rose s AND jack s story alone NO one ELSE DOT emotionally it IS entirely satisfying AND can LEAVE NO dry eye IN A theater OR home DOT the music has become iconic AND legendary DOT it IS composer james horner s finest soundtrack ever AND evokes so much FROM the film AND the audience DOT the song AFTER so LONG has become annoying but i still appreciate it FOR the phenomenon it IS AND this film IS DOT ONLY one problem the usual james cameron problem IS the dialogue which IS memorable but IN A bad way AS IN how cheesy it IS AT points but ALL that aside DOT james cameron has delivered A masterpiece AND A romantic epic that sweeps you away ON A journey OF A lifetime DOT my heart won T GO ON FROM this one DOT,safe.txt

aristocratic young lady betrothed BY cal billy zane DOT early ON the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio A LOWER CLASS artist ON his way TO america AFTER winning his ticket aboard titanic IN A poker game DOT IF he wants something he goes AND gets it unlike the UPPER CLASS who ARE so concerned WITH their social worries DOT the two fall IN love AND the audience sees the sinking OF the titanic primarily through their eyes DOT br br the movie begins IN modern times WITH the exploration OF the wreck BY A GROUP searching FOR treasures that sunk WITH the titanic which has recently occurred DOT

remembers TO help the SEARCH DOT she gets TO telling her memory OF the one AND ONLY voyage OF the titanic DOT WITH this the scene shifts TO southhampton ireland WHERE the titanic SET sail FROM ON april AS ALL the passengers ARE boarding DOT AFTER another stop ON the irish coast titanic went OUT TO see ON its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound FOR NEW york DOT historically the FIRST few days OF the voyage went BY uneventful but the fictional plot OF the story IS developed during this TIME AS rose sees the hopeless entrapement OF an engagement that she IS IN TO the wealthy cal hockley AND falls IN love WITH third CLASS passenger jack dawson DOT captain smith alledgedly AS shown IN the movie was urged BY the white star line director TO increase the speed OF the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines AND receive extra publicity BY arriving IN NEW york ON thursday night AND NOT ON friday morning AS planned DOT smith THEN ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years OF experience TO stretch the titanic s legs OUT TO FULL speed DOT the titanic had reports that the waters IN the atlantic they were sailing IN were FULL OF icebergs but they ignored these warnings AND proceeded AT FULL speed AS shown IN the movie DOT ON april AT an iceberg was sighted DOT they attempted TO shut OFF the engines AND turn the ship OUT OF the PATH OF the iceberg but there was NOT enough TIME AND the ship hit the iceberg ON the starboard side AS depicted IN the film DOT the portrayal OF the many small holes IN the side OF the ship AND NOT one LARGE gash along the side IS accurate DOT the crew OF titanic sent OUT distress calls AND SET OFF distress rockets AS shown UNTIL WHEN the lights finally failed DOT the lights OF the california were spotted six miles away but they failed TO realize what was going ON AND did NOT respond TO titanic s many pleas FOR help DOT the california had tried earlier IN the DAY TO warn titanic OF the severe ice that had caused them TO stop their trip but titanic had brushed them OFF causing the california TO turn OFF its radio AND LEAVE the titanic ON its own DOT the FIRST CLASS women AND children were the FIRST AS depicted TO be put INTO the twenty lifeboats that were ON the ship DOT overwhelmingly the third CLASS passengers suffered the most amount OF deaths OF ANY CLASS AND the crew was hit hard IN this tragedy too DOT the word OF white star line employees AND FIRST CLASS passengers was believed OVER that OF SECOND AND third CLASS passengers WHEN authorities were trying TO gain information OF the sinking DOT ALSO the metal that was used TO build the titanic has been FOUND IN recent years UNDER conditions OF severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank TO be extremely brittle DOT overall the basic plot IS very accurate IN its portayal OF the events AND the times AT which these events took place ON the titanic DOT br br many OF the CHARACTERS IN the story were NOT REAL AND created simply FOR the purpose OF the movie OR AS composite CHARACTERS TO represent possible CHARACTERISTICS AND ideas OF people ON the ship DOT the core GROUP OF rose jack cal AND rose s mother ALL were fictional CHARACTERS added INTO the story AS they represent different GROUPS OF people FROM the TIME DOT yet many CHARACTERS such AS the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay AND ALL OF the titanic s officers were REAL DOT the maiden voyage was going TO be captain edward smith s LAST voyage anyway AS he planned TO retire afterwards DOT he had been A part OF the white star line since WHERE he worked his way up TO his status AS the millionaire s captain WHEN the titanic sunk DOT the portrayals OF the officers IS accurate AS ONLY four survived the tragedy EXCEPT FOR the officer who threatened TO kill ALL OF the passengers OF the ship WITH his pistol DOT he IS ON record AS acting heroicly AND was misportrayed TO the point that james cameron apologized AND evoked A monument IN his honor IN the officer s former canadian hometown DOT AS shown IN the movie there was A LANGUAGE problem BETWEEN the crew AND many OF the LOWER CLASS passengers FROM non english speaking nations DOT IN addition officer lowe was the ONLY officer who came back IN the lifeboat AS depicted DOT the OLD people shown IN their bed AS the water came IN their room were based ON the strauss DOT NOT wanting TO LEAVE her husband s side mrs DOT strauss refused TO GET IN her lifeboat AND died WITH her husband ON the titanic DOT furthermore mr DOT goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy AND smoking A cigar reportedly did GO OUT LIKE this dressed IN his best DOT the richest man ON the ship john jacob astor who OWNED most OF manhattan died nonetheless AS well but his much younger wife was saved IN A lifeboat DOT IN addition molly brown was saved AND later had medals made up FOR the crew OF the carpethia that picked the survivors OF titanic up FROM the water DOT her ticket ON the titanic had COST OVER four thousand dollars AND BY the END OF her life she ended up broke DOT ALL OF the interiors OF the ship were masterfully replacated down TO the LAST pieces OF china AND silverware DOT the gymnasium which IS hardly seen IS recreated perfectly WITH ALL OF the machines reproduced TO MATCH those seen IN OLD photographs DOT the wonderful outfits AND costuming were an excellent re creation OF the post victorian era OF DOT the rich AT this TIME practically ruled everything AS the women s suffrage movement had NOT quite gotten moving yet DOT women during this TIME often married FOR financial SECURITY AS rose was considering doing AND normally took A back seast status TO their husbands AS cal wished FOR rose TO DO DOT the rich did NOT take well TO NEW money such AS molly brown AS depicted DOT everything OF the TIME was very formal DOT women had TO be escorted TO dinner BY A male figure AS seen WITH IN the dining scenes DOT smoking was NOT very common among women OF the TIME but holders OF cigarettes which were just coming IN AT the TIME were used AS seen WITH rose IN the movie DOT men OF the TIME generally smoked cigars NOT cigarettes DOT women were constained physically BY their corsets AND socially BY society DOT although james cameron had NO background IN historical films he brought IN experts OF titanic coupled WITH two years spent CROSS REFERENCING the history OF the titanic AND few liberties were taken DOT the beautiful cinematography AND special effects ALSO helped TO make the film even MORE breathtaking DOT br br A recognizable message can be seen IN the movie titanic AS the people ON the ship had about three hours TO contemplate their demise DOT the director james cameron shows the various reactions TO this TIME OF crisis IN people s lives DOT everyone reacts differently AND he gets you TO think OF how you might have reacted had you been IN that situation ON the titanic ON that fateful night DOT IN addition this film IS A reflection OF the s WHEN it was produced AS it gives A look INTO the wreck OF the titanic DOT ONLY IN the past fifteen years has the site OF the actual titanic been FOUND AND explored DOT this movie was able TO give us A deeper look INTO A disaster that many would NOT have viewed DOT however the moral question OF whether people today should be taking treasures FROM the wreck OF an underwater graveyard IS posed DOT there have been attempts TO stop treasure seeking missions such AS the one portrayed IN titanic but ALL have failed DOT AS it stands today anyone can make A voyage TO the titanic AND take whatever valuables they AS portrayed IN the film showing the GENERAL VALUES OF our TIME ON this matter DOT br br technically the film IS very well done DOT TO GET footage OF the wreck AT the bottom OF the ocean it took twelve dives TO GET ALL OF the footage needed FOR the movie DOT IN addition A special camera had TO be created TO withstand the intense pressure AT the bottom OF the ocean DOT cameron did NOT plan ON USING the probe TO GO AS far inside titanic AS anyone has IN the years since the ship sunk but it worked OUT that this provided an UNIQUE perspective INTO the ship DOT furthermore throughout the film fade ins AND outs FROM the wreck OF titanic TO the scene OF titanic during its actual voyage DOT this shift BETWEEN the modern scene TO the past scene during the voyage works AS an excellent transition that makes the story easy TO follow IN aclear manner DOT AT the very beginning OF the movie A septune recreation IS used TO recreate the scene WHEN the actual people LEFT the european coast ON titanic giving it distinction FROM the rest OF the events OF the film DOT br br titanic plays almost LIKE A historical biography AND IS LIKE A WORK OF art A TRUE epic DOT LIKE most history novels we know the ending but it doesn T take away FROM the wonderful treats that can be FOUND IN this picture DOT certain aspects

127,superman ii the richard donner cut should be A fan s dream come TRUE DOT AT LONG LAST footage ONLY seen IN photos AND scenes that ONLY existed ON the printed page would finally come TO life DOT A director that was unable TO complete his vision would have the opportunity TO have his vision restored DOT it seems LIKE A winning situation DOT AND THEN you START watching this assembly OF footage AND you realize this esoteric dream IS A very REAL nightmare OF sloppiness AND incompetence DOT WHILE it s entirely possible that NO movie could compete WITH the finished perfect VERSION EACH OF us has imagined OVER the years it really should have been A thrill TO finally see this project DOT AND it IS ONLY A very few times DOT br br you know things ARE shaky WHEN the very FIRST BIT OF TEXT ON screen looks LIKE home brew computer graphics DOT but THEN we START seeing NEW footage alternates FROM superman the movie FOR the trial AND that FIRST BIT OF hesitation fades away DOT hey this IS pretty neat things ARE alright FOR these few fleeting moments UNTIL we see footage FROM stm intermixed WITH NEW effects FOR this project AND it doesn T convince AT ALL DOT AND FROM this point ON it never ever lets up DOT it s probably NOT RIGHT TO judge A movie because OF bad visual effects but WHEN this IS supposedly the direct follow up TO A movie whose tag line was you ll believe A man can fly it s difficult TO believe anything shown ON screen here DOT the best effects IN this ARE FROM the original productions DOT br br another issue WITH this re cut DOT A lot OF it just doesn T make sense DOT the ONLY reason ANY OF it really works IS because we ve ALL seen the theatrical VERSION OF superman ii A movie that does make sense DOT lester s superman ii fills IN the holes OF this assembly DOT part OF this could be because donner didn T GET TO complete shooting the other part could be because the makers OF this project were intent ON USING AS little lester material AS possible DOT what we END up WITH IS an assembly OF footage that makes superman iv look airtight AND coherent DOT br br AFTER viewing this one gets the sense that WHILE lester was faithful AND comfortable USING donner material michael thau AND his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed BY lester DOT the best scenes IN the donner cut ARE the ones lifted relatively intact FROM the released VERSION OF superman ii DOT that includes the moon SEQUENCE AND the diner SEQUENCE NOT ironically BOTH were filmed BY donner DOT but anything ELSE FROM that movie filmed BY lester IS re edited IN such A hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem LIKE A ham fisted know NOTHING DOT WHILE lester honored the donner material lester here IS thrown UNDER the bus DOT br br so IS there anything good IN this RELEASE well marlon brando IS IN it AND that s neat TO see DOT IN fact watching ANY OF the material shot BY donner IS neat since it was ALL filmed AT the same TIME AS superman the movie DOT but that ONLY highlights the problems OF this RELEASE DOT ANY OF the major scenes really just lois jumping AND scenes WITH marlon brando would have been better served AS completed scenes IN A deleted scenes SECTION DOT INSTEAD they ARE shoe horned INTO A nonsensical narrative WITH inferior performances many alternate takes FROM familiar scenes ARE used sloppy edits AND bad decisions DOT br br watch the opening scene AT the daily planet DOT why ARE we looking AT jackie cooper s back AS he calls FOR lois AND clark AT the END why DO we have lois walking INTO her dark apartment ONLY TO have that followed BY jackie cooper walking INTO A dark bathroom turning the lights ON i was INITIALLY confused BY this because i expected TO see lois DOT the entire assembly IS filled WITH questionable choices LIKE this DOT br br battle scenes ARE A mess too WITH NO geography BETWEEN cuts DOT it s just random ACTION DOT OF course the major ACTION scenes were shot BY lester AND his material IS ONLY used AS A bridge TO the NEXT SET OF donner outtakes OR alternates DOT they should have used MORE OF lester s footage but probably had too much pride TO admit that DOT br br the sloppiness extends TO the military missile AS well DOT AS noted elsewhere the missile shown IN the donner cut bears the designation xk WHILE we ALL know it s the xk A blind man IN stm knows that the producers OF this assembly who tried so hard TO honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes IN AND that mistake IS indicative OF the quality OF the entire production DOT FOR ALL the supposed care that was put INTO this the FINAL product has an air OF shoddiness TO it that IS inescapable DOT br br the entire affair would probably be easier TO digest IF warner s didn T make this A separate RELEASE here IN the states DOT AS it IS we re expected TO pay FOR what IS essentially A bonus disc OF deleted scenes WITH A play ALL OPTION DOT it s really ONLY worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but AFTER that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet FOR dust AND little ELSE DOT i know AFTER my experience OF watching this i had NEW RESPECT FOR lester s VERSION DOT it s BY NO means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were IN the script that stand OUT here IN bold relief DOT he managed TO make A movie that has entertained FOR many years AND will CONTINUE TO DO so WHILE this NEW re cut will most likely ONLY be remembered AS A footnote IN that films history DOT,safe.txt

seeing pokmon IN theaters i can T help but wonder how these american producers READ the japanese scripts DOT the way it appears it seems that they READ AND see something that says INSERT EMPTY moral

there s the theme song DOT i couldn T help but roll my eyes AT this one DOT the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou AND was sung BY japanese children DOT it was fun AND enjoyable DOT this

turn i was hoping that this would NOT turn INTO A moral fest LIKE msb did AT the END OF the english VERSION DOT THEN comes nintendo POWER IN which i see ALL my fears realized IN the words the main

theater i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved IN japanese being turned INTO complete AND utter junk DOT i hear COMMENTS that say it was better because the moral was MORE subtle DOT i can see A point IN that since they didn T pander this thing repeating it OVER AND OVER LIKE IN msb DOT however it did MORE damage than anything ELSE IN this movie DOT FIRST OF ALL the legend that was READ throughout was changed A BIT TO READ the world turns TO ash DOT ah hah DOT so ash IS the chosen one whatever DOT IN the japanese VERSION the inhabitants OF arshia needed A pokmon trainer TO carry OUT their traditional ceremony DOT this TIME he s the chosen one DOT A greater way that this did damage was TO lugia DOT lugia was one OF the coolest CHARACTERS IN A pokmon

discussing the conditions OF lugia s existence NOT that ash IS going TO make ALL the difference DOT overall IN this category ash wasn T really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped BY many along the way DOT br br A lot OF the other stuff IS kind OF nit picking DOT furura s flute song wasn T nearly AS sweet AND enjoyable AS the japanese one DOT jirarudan s speech TO

AND don s DOT davis AS major GENERAL george s DOT hammond DOT FOR ten LONG years we watched the team battle against the goa uld the replicators the ori AND many other aggressors DOT AT the same TIME

DOT AND sometimes NOT even THEN DOT br br AS WITH ALL LONG running series they were numerous CAST changes DOT michael shanks LEFT the series IN january AT the END OF its fifth season IN ORDER TO broaden his horizons AS an actor DOT daniel jackson s successor AS the team s resident archaeologist geek was jonas quinn an alien FROM A country CALLED kelowna ON the planet langara played BY corin nemec DOT however shanks returned AT the beginning OF the seventh season IN june AND nemec LEFT AT the same TIME DOT unfortunately he made ONLY one further guest appearance AND his CHARACTER was seldom mentioned afterwards DOT don s DOT davis LEFT the series AT the END OF the seventh season IN march AS he felt that it was TIME FOR him TO GO DOT the SHOW s original star AND arguably its most popular actor richard dean anderson starred IN the series throughout its FIRST eight seasons DOT his participation IN the seventh AND eight seasons was noticeably less than IN the earlier seasons DOT he finally LEFT sg IN march IN ORDER TO spend MORE TIME WITH his THEN six YEAR OLD daughter DOT jack o neill was BY far my favourite CHARACTER IN the series AND truth be told i never enjoyed the LAST two seasons AS much AS i did the earlier episodes FOR that very reason DOT br br the ninth season represented A NEW era FOR the programme DOT WITH the departure OF its LEAD actor AND the defeat OF the goa uld AND the replicators IN season eight many fans felt the series should GO OUT ON A high DOT regardless the series carried ON FOR A further two years WITH the ori replacing the goa uld AS the series main adversaries DOT three NEW CHARACTERS were brought IN TO fill the gaps AS it were AND help usher IN this re invention DOT ben browder came IN AS the cocky southern air FORCE pilot lt DOT colonel cameron mitchell the NEW leader OF sg DOT his farscape co star the lovely claudia black began TO play A prominent ROLE IN the series AS the vivacious sexy hilarious AND certainly extroverted vala mal doran A former goa uld host AND con artist FROM another planet DOT A recurring guest star during the eighth AND ninth seasons she joined the CAST FULL TIME AT the beginning OF its tenth AND FINAL season DOT rounding OFF the CAST was the legendary beau bridges AS major GENERAL hank landry the NEW commander OF the sgc AND an OLD friend OF jack o neill AND GENERAL hammond DOT FOR the LAST two years they starred alongside the sg faithful michael shanks amanda tapping AND christopher judge AND became valuable parts OF AND made equally valuable contributions TO the stargate franchise DOT br br alas ALL good things must come TO an END DOT during the initial broadcast OF the FIRST several episodes OF season ten ratings dropped considerably resulting IN cancellation IN its august DOT AFTER ten seasons AND episodes the dream was finally OVER DOT ON march what began WITH children OF the gods ended WITH unending DOT the series finale made its world premiere ON sky one IN britain AND ireland BEFORE being shown ON the sci fi channel IN the united states ON june DOT br br IN the ten years that the series was ON the air it amassed legions OF fans AND even eclipsed the science fiction series star trek IN terms OF popularity IN certain countries DOT it became the SECOND longest running sci fi series IN the world SECOND ONLY TO doctor who AND the longest running american produced sci fi series HAVING surpassed the x files ONLY A few months BEFORE it ended DOT br br stargate sg represents the cornerstone OF the stargate franchise DOT IN its success AND popularity led TO the production OF A spin OFF series entitled stargate atlantis which was regrettably cancelled AFTER five seasons AND episodes IN august DOT although PLANS FOR another feature film fell through two direct TO dvd films stargate the ark OF truth AND stargate continuum were released IN AND MORE ARE planned FOR the NOT too distant future DOT A third live ACTION series stargate universe IS ALSO due TO premiere AT SOME point NEXT YEAR DOT there was unfortunately an animated series stargate infinity which ran ONLY FROM TO but the less said about that the better DOT despite the END OF sg AND atlantis AS continuing series the future OF stargate looks very bright indeed DOT br br IN conclusion WHILE stargate has yet TO gain the same DEGREE OF popular recognition AS other major sci fi television

government gold cash the cheyenne need TO buy guns WITH so IN short ORDER the soldiers ARE wiped OUT AND cresta flees TO the hills accompanied BY honus gant peter strauss the lone surviving cavalryman DOT calling gant BY the snarky nickname soldier blue cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was TIME well spent outstripping gant IN survival skills common sense AND sheer balls AND OVER their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements A band OF hostile kiowa an unscrupulous trader played BY donald pleasance here giving one OF his most ridiculous performances AND that s saying something AND IN the tradition OF many previous western SET romantic comedies EACH other DOT br br during the course OF their misadventures the two opposites ARE inevitably AND predictably attracted TO EACH other AND eventually END up getting it ON WHILE gant has A freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg NO less IN what was surely the ONLY conveniently

such A primo apartment there i GO thinking IN nyc REAL estate terms again DOT br br realizing that their love could never flourish outside OF the cave cresta leaves gant AND makes it TO the fort BY herself ONLY TO discover that the moron IN charge won T spare A couple OF men so they can rescue gant the regiment needs ALL available personnel TO launch an attack ON the nearby cheyenne village AND once cresta gets wind OF that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby TO be AND makes A beeline straight TO the cheyenne TO warn them OF what s coming DOT br br what happens NEXT IS what gained the film its infamy it turns OUT that ALL the wacky misadventures AND squabbling were ALL just A LEAD IN TO A hideous reenactment OF the sand creek massacre an orgy OF rape torture AND GENERAL sadistic evil perpetrated IN the NAME OF keeping the country clean AND almost forty years AFTER its RELEASE this SEQUENCE still disturbs AND nauseates FOR its sheer cruelty DOT children ARE trampled beneath the hooves OF charging horses OR impaled ON bayonets unarmed people ARE beheaded A nice effect i have TO admit women ARE stripped AND pawed BY gangs OF slavering brutes THEN raped AND mutilated IN one truly sickening INSTANCE A naked native woman puts up too much OF A fight so her rapist INSTEAD decides TO cut OFF her breasts which we thankfully ONLY see the START OF BEFORE the camera moves ON TO

exploitative manner IN which the atrocities ARE depicted DOT br br i M ALL IN favor OF westerns that don T shy away FROM honest portrayals OF how the west was won OR stolen IF truth be told but this film has NO idea OF what kind OF movie it wants TO be one MINUTE it s A heavy handed pseudo hippy lecture about how the treatment OF the natives was totally effed up well duh THEN it s A light hearted battle OF the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant IS AND manages TO look hot IN her tasty red calico poncho WITH NO undies but that ALL goes OUT the WINDOW WHEN donald pleasance shows up WITH an unintentionally hilarious pair OF buck toothed dentures AND our heroes must figure OUT how TO ESCAPE FROM his murderous clutches IN A sub plot that goes nowhere ALL OF which

minutes FOR ALL they were worth IN the film s promotion AND poster imagery DOT br br but BY trying TO be ALL things TO ALL audiences soldier blue ends up AS an incoherent preachy mulligan stew OF presumably well intentioned political correctness but IF they were going TO tell the story OF the sand creek massacre wouldn T it have been A good idea TO have SOME indian CHARACTERS who were MORE

659,WHEN A movie OF A book seems pointless AND incomprehensible the cause can invariably be FOUND IN the book either it was pointless TO START WITH OR the point IS one NOT easily conveyed TO film OR the movie missed the point which IS the most frequent OF these results AND the easiest TO happen especially WHEN the point IS one NOT easily DEFINED DOT the book morvern callar has A point EVERY reader OF the book must have felt this AND felt AS IF he had gotten it but i suspect most OF them could NOT STATE it IN words DOT i M NOT sure i can myself but perhaps it comes TO this OR something LIKE it things come things GO such IS life but we carry ON OR AT ANY rate SOME OF us people LIKE morvern DO DOT NO doubt A MORE erudite critic could construct A MORE adequate definition DOT but the important fact IS that there IS A point possibly the SUM OF the entire story IS the point AND that this would have been the main thing TO keep IN VIEW AND TO carry OVER IN adapting the story TO film DOT the maker OF this film evidently missed the point AND doesn T substitute one OF her own AND so the film IS about NOTHING DOT br br this IS NOT the usual complaint OF A book lover that his favorite TEXT has been violated DOT the merit OF the book IS something i conceded grudgingly IN reading it i FOUND it A bloody nuisance AND an occasion FOR kicking the author IN the pants AND getting him IN TO finish the job properly DOT the narrative IS supposed TO be the WORK OF the half educated morvern but that illusion IS constantly dispelled BY A dozen different TYPES OF literary effect AS IF the author were poking AT her WITH his pen there ARE inconsistencies OF STYLE AND tone AS IF different sections had been composed AT different times AND ANY conclusions i could reach about morvern had TO remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended AND which he did NOT FOR INSTANCE despite morvern s own SELF characterization AS A raver am i wrong that IN the END she remains essentially A working CLASS scots girl AND beneath her wrapping OF music downloads NOT so different FROM those OF generations past IN ANY CASE despite my irritation AT the author i couldn T deny that his book stuck WITH me AND what i couldn T GET OUT OF my head was his CHARACTER s attitude her angle ON the world which was almost AS vivid AS A goya portrait DOT morvern IS the kind OF person who s ALWAYS encountering situations AT once rather comic AND rather horrible occasionally she invites them but MORE often they land ON her LIKE flies so that much OF her life consists OF A kind OF gauche but graceful slogging through unconsciously practical AND unconsciously philosophical AND that doesn T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE it idiosyncratically enough DOT the complex OF incidents AND OF morvern s responses TO them ARE the substance OF the book AND its achievement IN exposing A CROSS SECTION OF existence it would be difficult TO illuminate otherwise FOR ALL my dislike OF the book i can see this DOT br br the morvern just described IS NOT the morvern OF the movie OR IF it IS most OF her IS kept offscreen DOT an actress who might have been A good fit FOR the CHARACTER had she been the RIGHT age AT the RIGHT TIME IS angharad rees FROM the OLD tv series poldark DOT samantha morton THEN would seem LIKE good casting she s rather the same sort OF actress AND IN one OF her earlier movies jesus son she played A girl who WITH A few adjustments could have been turned INTO this one DOT unfortunately AS the film turned OUT she doesn T have the CHARACTER FROM the book TO play DOT FOR one thing the book IS one that IF it IS TO be dramatized virtually cries OUT FOR monologues BY the main CHARACTER TO the audience WITHOUT her COMMENTS her perspective her voice the story loses most OF its meaning DOT it has lost MORE OF it IN that the adaptor has expurgated it OF its comic AND horrible elements the most memorable incidents FROM the book ARE curtailed BEFORE they turn grotty AND so morvern s responses whether OF amusement OR distaste depending ON her mood ARE missing too AND the incidents NO longer have A reason FOR being IN the story DOT IN short the filmmaker chose FOR SOME reason TO turn A brisk edgy serio comic novel INTO A genteel art tv film AND chose AS her typical image one OF ms DOT morton languishing IN A artistically shaded melancholy AS IF the outing morvern signs up FOR were A tour OF the stations OF the CROSS DOT this isn T AT ALL what the book OR the morvern OF the book was about DOT FOR another thing the morvern OF the movie isn T scottish the actress said IN an interview she hadn T had TIME TO study up the accent AND she ought TO be it s important that she her FAMILY AND her mates ARE ALL FROM A single place DOT AND finally the film IS missing the END OF the story morvern s spending ALL she has AND coming home TO icy darkness it s winter the dam has frozen the POWER has gone OUT AND the pub IS dark DOT minus this AND minus ALL OF the rest what s LEFT IS A failed art film A dead film about A subject whose strength lay precisely IN her refusal OR native inability ever TO give IN TO being dead DOT,safe.txt

692,jim carrey IS back TO much the same ROLE that he played IN the mask A timid guy who IS trying TO GET ahead IN the world but who seems TO be plagued WITH bad luck DOT even WHEN he tries TO help A homeless guy FROM being harassed BY A bunch OF hoodlums AND OF course they have TO be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires DOT IN that CASE it wasn T too hard TO predict that he was about TO have A handful OF angry hoodlums but i LIKE that the movie suggests that things LIKE that shouldn T be ignored DOT i M reminded OF the episode OF michael moore s brilliant the awful truth WHEN they had A man lay down ON the sidewalk AND pretend TO be dead AND see who would actually stop AND make sure he was okay DOT the results were NOT very promising so it s nice TO see someone IN the movies setting A good example DOT br br jim carrey plays the part OF bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems TO be falling apart DOT OR even better it seems TO be breaking up BY the blows OF bad luck LIKE an asteroid entering the atmosphere A little metaphor that comes up WHEN bruce miraculously finds himself A gigantic news story later IN the film DOT bruce IS nearly years OLD AND ALL he has TO SHOW FOR it IS A POSITION AS A news reporter OF the sort that reports ON such exciting news AS the LOCAL bakery that s seeking TO bake the world s biggest cookie DOT he s desperate TO obtain the job OF head anchor AT the tv station but he loses his cool ON live tv WHEN he hears that the job went TO his rival colleague DOT you have TO love how they TIME the revelation OF this news TO him seconds BEFORE his FIRST live report DOT needless TO say he loses his temper ON live tv IN one OF the funniest scenes OF the entire film DOT br br morgan freeman delivers A fantastic performance AS the man himself displaying A god whose infinite wisdom IS somewhat reflected through freeman s massive talent AS an actor DOT he IS the kind OF god who takes his job very seriously but IN such A way AS TO advise his followers AS well AS the viewers OF this movie that there ARE times WHEN you need TO slow down AND DO SOME manual labor IN life DOT i love his line that SOME OF the happiest people IN the world come home smelling TO high heaven AT the END OF the DAY DOT there ARE A lot OF people IN the world maybe MORE than our SHARE IN america who ARE so absorbed BY their money AND their possessions AND their jobs AND everything that they completely lost touch WITH the NATURAL side OF themselves AS humans DOT br br one OF the biggest strengths IS that the movie IS able TO provide great advice TO people IN GENERAL about improving their lives AND this message IS clear AND acceptable regardless OF the viewer s religion DOT i FOR example tend TO reject organized religion IN ALL forms AND i see god AND satan TO be metaphors FOR different aspects OF nature AND human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived OR CONTINUE TO live DOT but despite the fact that i don T believe that god EXISTS AS an entity overseeing the universe OR AS A janitor dressed ALL IN white who mops the floors OF his downtown office IN his spare TIME i was able TO appreciate the messages that were delivered IN this movie DOT br br jim carrey s movies display this fantastic evolution that TIES them ALL together AND makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he s come DOT IF you compare bruce almighty WITH movies LIKE ace ventura BOTH OF which i loved BY the way OR A lot OF what he did BEFORE he got INTO film it s amazing how far he s come DOT he has moved FROM cheesy tv comedy TO cheesy comedic films TO comedies that ARE truly intelligent AND meaningful LIKE this film AS well AS OTHERS LIKE the truman SHOW man ON the moon AND the majestic easily one OF his GREATEST films ever DOT jim carrey has unmistakably moved FROM the cheesy comedy OF his past TO become one OF the most important comic actors working today DOT br br jennifer aniston ALSO once again provides an excellent addition TO the movie AS she did IN the side splitting office SPACE AS bruce s girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated BY bruce s growing stress about his life AS well AS his negligence TO ask her TO marry him DOT there IS definitely SOME low brow comedy IN the film that doesn T really fit WITH the importance OF the film s meaning OR the quality OF the delivery such AS the dog reading the newspaper ON the toilet AND the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice TO see ace ventura s friend spike make A cameo appearance DOT AS stephen king very well knows it s ALWAYS nice TO see familiar CHARACTERS DOT it s almost LIKE seeing FAMILY again DOT br br bruce IS endowed WITH the powers OF god FOR A given PERIOD OF TIME so that he can understand life A BIT better AND he says A lot about himself WHEN he uses the powers ONLY FOR his own purposes rather than TO help ALL OF the people who pray TO him DOT the thing i love about this IS that LIKE i said BEFORE religion IS ABSENT FROM my life but i was able TO watch this AND learn A lot about myself AS well BY thinking about what kinds OF things i would have done had i been endowed WITH such powers DOT the movie allows us TO learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even MORE DOT br br the scenes that involve the news station ARE easily the funniest IN the entire film such AS the scene WHEN bruce loses his temper about the anchor POSITION the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried WITH an original birth certificate AND A complete SET OF dental records the scene WHERE bruce s rival colleague IS made TO GO nuts ON camera AND my favorites the ones AT the beginning AND the END involving the LOCAL bakery s cooking DOT the movie has plenty OF TIME FOR carrey TO deliver SOME excellent jokes such AS WHEN he says TO god who reveals that he s the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be REAL bashes AND TO be careful about drinking because ON OF him might need A ride home i ALSO loved the END WHEN he says that behind EVERY great man IS A woman rolling her eyes DOT A little too TRUE AND AS gallagher would ADD behind EVERY great man IS ALSO an amazed mother IN law DOT br br bruce almighty IS one OF the MORE memorable comedies TO have come OUT FOR quite A WHILE AND IS probably the ONLY directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious TO buy ON dvd TO ADD TO my personal collection DOT it IS A comedy written AND performed IN good taste but WITH enough relatively low brow humor TO keep the kids entertained DOT this IS A meaningful comedy FOR the whole FAMILY which IS becoming rarer AND rarer these days DOT IN A world that IS about TO be flogged WITH yet another american pie

meant TO evoke his dawning revelation but sounding MORE LIKE we re about TO hear A very special track BY the emotions he realizes that his son IS gay DOT br br his FIRST impulse IS i ll kill him DOT i ll kill him DOT THEN rf goes ON A LONG walk wherein he cycles through ALL OF the thoughts A confused parent might have such AS maybe we toilet trained him too soon DOT his thoughts ARE ALL triggered BY something he sees ON his walk FOR INSTANCE A burly truck driver appearing just AS he IS contemplating what makes A REAL man DOT surprisingly he goes TO A bookstore AND buys about eight books ON homosexuality DOT this it must be said IS about eight MORE books ON homosexuality than my parents bought DOT he THEN goes straight TO A park bench AND READS them ALL br br rf THEN hires audrey A six foot amazon prostitute IN this amazing fur thing played BY tamara dobson OF cleopatra jones DOT he hired her FOR norman TO try OUT heterosexuality but this pisses norman AND he storms OUT TO GO stay

relationship they don T seem TO have ANY rapport AND norman has NO qualms whatsoever about kicking garson OUT AND even WHEN he comes around TO stand up FOR himself he never defends garson OR talks about their relationship DOT there were SOME kind OF sweetly quaint touches LIKE rf going TO buy ALL those books ON homosexuality AND sitting RIGHT down ON the park bench TO READ them i LIKE the idea that A parent would actually try TO find something OUT about homosexuality rather than just run OFF TO GET drunk OR commiserate WITH his friends DOT br br other than that it s kind OF just what it seems LIKE A little relic OF A bygone era an era IN which SOME gay people thought that IF uptight straight people just sat down AND watched A drag marionette performance we could ALL learn TO love AND understand one another AND because OF the whole naivet OF this thing the extreme stereotypes AND message laden dialogue just come OFF AS charmingly outdated AND provide A great deal OF grist FOR

996,i had never heard OF this film BEFORE A couple OF weeks ago but its concept interested me WHEN i heard it an american man meets A european woman ON his LAST night IN europe AND they spend the night together talking DOT it sparked my interest but i never expected it TO be this great DOT BEFORE sunrise IS A masterpiece AND it s ALSO one OF the most romantic films ON record DOT TO my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism OF the s DOT it s impossible TO really talk too much about it since there IS NO REAL plot so TO speak although there ARE plenty OF thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it IS sort OF LIKE my dinner WITH andre WHERE there IS A conversation but it s NOT just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it DOT see it,safe.txt

998,many OF the criticisms ON this thread seem TO pick A comparison OF this film WITH the mortal storm OR casablanca DOT everyone IS entitled TO compare films they choose but the similarities OF the mortal storm AND watch ON the rhine ARE clearly the problems OF refugees threatened BY the nazi juggernaut WHILE the main comparative point brought OUT WITH casablanca IS the seeming unjust treatment OF humphrey bogart IN BY the academy OF motion picture arts AND science because they chose paul lukas INSTEAD FOR the best actor oscar DOT it does NOT strike me AS totally wrong DOT lukas had A good career IN film BOTH here AND IN england he IS the villain IN the lady vanishes AND this performance was his best one DOT bogart had MORE great performances IN him than rick blaine FOR INSTANCE he was ignored FOR sam spade IN the maltese falcon AND roy earle IN high sierra two years earlier BOTH OF which were FIRST rate performances AND he would NOT GET an oscar FOR his GREATEST performances AS fred C DOT dobbs IN the treasure OF sierra madres the writer murder suspect IN IN A lonely place AND captain philip francis queeg IN the caine mutiny afterward he got it FOR charley IN the african queen DOT i think that bogie should have got it FOR the ROLE OF dobbs but it did NOT happen DOT but lukas was lucky he got it ON the defining performance OF his lesser career DOT few can claim that DOT br br TO me the film TO look AT WITH watch ON the rhine IS based ON another play script BY hellman the searching wind DOT they BOTH look AT america s spirit OF isolationism IN the s AND s DOT the searching wind IS really looking AT the whole inter war PERIOD WHILE watch ON the rhine SET IN the years just proceeding our entry INTO world war ii deals WITH A few weeks OF TIME DOT therefore it IS better constructed AS A play AND MORE meaningful FOR it s impact DOT br br the film has many good performances led BY lukas AS the exhausted but determined anti nazi fighter courier davis AS his loyal wife wisely keeping her CHARACTER AS low keyed AS possible due TO lukas being the center OF the play s activities coulouris AS the selfish conniving but ultimately foolish AND ineffective teck lucille watson AS the mother OF davis AND geraldine fitzgerald AS coulouris wiser AND sadder AND fed up wife AND kurt katch who delivers A devastating critique AS the LOCAL embassy s gestapo chief about coulouris AND OTHERS who would deal WITH the nazis DOT it has dialog WITH bite IN it DOT AND what it says IS quite TRUE DOT it ALSO has moments OF near poetry DOT witness the scene towards the END WHEN coulouris IS LEFT alone WITH lukas AND davis AND says the NEW world has LEFT the scene TO the OLD world DOT hellman could WRITE very well AT times DOT br br given the strength OF the film script AND performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films DOT,safe.txt
